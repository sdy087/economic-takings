\part{A Case Study of Norwegian Waterfalls}

\chapter{Norwegian Waterfalls and Hydropower}\label{chap:3}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:into3}

Norway is country of mountains, fjords and rivers, where around 95 \% of the annual domestic electricity supply comes from hydropower.\footnote{See Statistics Norway, data from the year 2011, http://www.ssb.no/en/elektrisitetaar/.} The right to harness energy from waterfalls tends to belong to the local landowners under a riparian system.\footnote{This arrangement is rooted in the first known legal sources in Norway, the so-called ``Gulating'' laws, thought to have been in force well before AD 1000. See \cite[111-112,120]{robberstad81}. Historically, the emphasis was on traditional agrarian water resources, such as fishing rights. However, new sticks were added to the waterfall bundle over the years, including the right to develop hydropower. For an historical overview, I point to \cite[14-32]{vislie44}. For a detailed presentation of the history of water law in pre-industrial times, I refer to \cite{motzfeld08}. \noo{It has been disputed whether or not the historical notion of private ownership in Norway included a robust dominion concept, or whether it was mainly based on a bundled notion of use rights. In relation to the right to {\it regulate} the flow of water in a river system, an activity with potentially significant ramifications for many owners as well as society in general, many argued that this right was not included in the riparian bundle, but belonged to the state. Indeed, this view was arguably behind the adoption of the concession acts of 1917 (and their precursors from 1909). Indeed, at the time that these acts were passed, there was considerable doubt as to whether or not the state could pass such acts at all, if the the right to regulate fell under private property. Hence, arguing that the right to regulate was not subject to private property became a reasoning strategy in this regard. The validity of this argument still appears to be unresolved, but today it is much less important, since the regulatory authority of the state is in any case thought to encompass provisions such as those introduced in the concession acts.}} Historically, waterfalls were very important to local communities, particularly as a source of power for flour and saw mills.\footnote{See \cite[121]{tvedt13}.} The fact that peasants in Norway owned and managed their own water resources can help explain why they traditionally enjoyed great freedom, both economically and socially, compared to many other places in Europe.\footnote{See \cite[121]{tvedt13}.}

Following the industrial revolution, local ownership and management came under increasing pressure, first from commercial interests, then from the state, following the introduction of a more centralised management system. This process gained momentum after the Second World War, when the Norwegian electricity sector came to be organised as a distributed monopoly. Following this, most hydropower schemes would be carried out by non-commercial bodies that were committed to providing a public service, and which were often under direct political control.\footnote{See generally \cite{skjold06}.} 

Then, in the early 1990s, the energy sector was reformed again, largely inspired by the market-orientation and privatisation of the public sector in the UK under Thatcher.\footnote{See generally \cite{midttun98}.} The production sector was liberalised, leading to a process of commercialisation. At the same time, the regulatory system was decoupled from both political and commercial decision-making processes, to become more expert-based. Moreover, the sector underwent significant centralisation, as a result of mergers and acquisitions.

Following the reform, access rights to the national grid were to be granted equally to all potential actors on the energy market, including private companies.\footnote{See generally \cite{hammer96}. For an interesting presentation and analysis of grid-based markets in general, see \cite{falch04}.} After the passage of the \cite{ea90}, the energy companies controlling the local grids were no longer authorised to shut out competitors.\footnote{See the \cite[3-4]{ea90}.} A side-effect of this is that it has become possible for local landowners to undertake their own hydropower projects. Local owners can now access the grid to sell the electricity they produce on the market.\footnote{See generally \cite{larsen06,larsen08,larsen12}.} This has led to increased tension between local interests and established hydropower companies. The following fundamental question arises: who is entitled to benefit from waterfalls, and who is entitled to a say in decision-making processes concerning their use?

In this chapter, I will set the stage for discussing this question in more depth, by detailing how the hydropower sector is organised. I will look to the law as well as to commercial and administrative practices and I will focus on those aspects that have changed following the reform of the early 1990s. I pay particular attention to the growing importance and competitiveness of so-called {\it small-scale} hydropower, including development projects that are undertaken by local owners, or in cooperation with them. Several commercial actors have emerged who now specialise in such cooperation, by offering waterfall owners a significant share of the commercial value resulting from development. 

%As a result of this, owners and local communities are not alone in opposing those actors on the market that wish to continue to make use of expropriation and other monopoly powers. Indeed, a main line of conflict between ``new'' and ``old'' actors on the market concerns the conditions for acquiring waterfalls. Most of the large energy companies still expect to acquire waterfalls cheaply, if necessary by using expropriation. But their new competitors often represent a counterweight to this, as they seek to gain a competitive advantage by cooperating with owners. Hence, the current power play for control over Norwegian waterfalls is also relevant to the functioning of the newly emerging electricity market.  
%
%The issues that have emerged in recent years do not merely concern opposing commercial interests of individuals and companies, but also involve the local communities directly affected by development. Indeed, the original owners of waterfalls in Norway tend to be farmers residing in these communities. Therefore, if one adopts a property-based perspective on benefit sharing and governance, one is also lead to consider the wider social and political ramifications of property rights in waterfalls. This is particularly clear if one adopts a social function understanding of property, as I argued for in Chapter \ref{chap:1}.

To bring out the multi-faceted character of the current debate on hydropower in Norway, I will begin in Section \ref{sec:nutshell} by offering a basic overview of the Norwegian political system. I will focus on the role that property, and particularly rights to water, has played in the history of Norwegian democracy. In Section \ref{sec:hl}, I move on to describe the law relating to hydropower development. I first identify a basic tension in the law -- some would call it an inconsistency -- between hydropower as a private right on the one hand, and a public good on the other. I then go on to explain how this tension permeates the law, by presenting the statutory regulation of hydropower development in more depth.

I follow this up by considering hydropower in practice, especially those practices that relate to small-scale development in cooperation with local owners. I trace the history of the dominant model used to organise this form of development, going back to the first expression I could find of the core principles, given in the so-called {\it Nordhordlandsmodellen}, from 1996.\footnote{See  \cite{dyrkolbotn96}.} I note how the core financial compensation mechanism presented there was later adopted by the market. However, I also discuss other ideas expressed in the model, regarding the importance of sustainable governance, the involvement of non-owners, and the desirability of long-term planning rooted in local conditions and based on local participation in decision-making processes.

In Section \ref{sec:future}, I go on to observe that these non-financial aspects of the model have largely failed to make an impact on the market, and I hypothesise that this might be part of the reason why small-scale hydropower now appears to be falling out of favour. I note, moreover, how a recent change in the perception of small-scale hydropower has also lead to a resurgence of large-scale development. This, I argue, is now threatening to undermine the position of local communities and owners.

Based on this, I argue for the importance of maintaining a social function perspective on local ownership of waterfalls. Hence, my analysis in this chapter largely echoes the theoretical discussion presented in the first two chapters. Moreover, I set the stage for the chapters to follow, wherein I specifically address the use of expropriation -- and alternatives to it --  to facilitate hydropower development.

\section{Norway in a Nutshell}\label{sec:nutshell}

Norway is a constitutional monarchy, based on a representative system of government.\footnote{For constitutional law in Norway, see generally \cite{andenes06}.} The executive branch is led by the King in Council, the Cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister of Norway. Legislative power is vested in the Storting, the Norwegian parliament, elected by popular vote in a multi-party setting.\footnote{It should be noted that the executive branch also enjoys considerable legislative power under Norwegian law. Both informally, because it prepares new legislation, and also formally, because it has a wide delegated power to issue so-called {\it directives} (forskrifter). Indeed, it is typical for acts of parliament to include a general delegation rule which permits the executive to legislate further on the matters dealt with in the act, by clarifying and filling in the gaps left open by it.} In 1884, the parliamentary system first triumphed in Norway, as the cabinet was forced to resign after it lost the confidence of the Storting. The principle has since obtained the status of a constitutional custom. In particular, the cabinet can not continue to sit if the Storting expresses mistrust against it, although an express vote of confidence is not required. In practice, due to the multi-party nature of Norwegian politics, minority cabinets are quite common. These can sustain themselves by making long-term deals with supporting parties, or by looking for a majority in the Storting on a case-by-case basis.

The judiciary is organised in three levels, with 70 district courts, 6 courts of appeal, and the Supreme Court. The district courts have general jurisdiction over most legal matters; there is no division between constitutional, administrative, civil, criminal courts. \footnote{However, a special court exists for {\it land consolidation}, and both the district courts and the courts of appeal follow special procedural rules in {\it appraisement disputes}, for instance when compensation is awarded following expropriation. See the \cite{lca79} and the \cite{aa17} respectively.} The courts of appeal have a similarly broad scope. Moreover, the right to appeal is considered basic, although not absolute.\footnote{In civil cases, for instance, it is generally required that the stakes are above a certain lower threshold, measured in terms of the appellants' financial interest in the outcome. See \cite[29-13]{da05}.}  The Supreme Court, on the other hand, operates a very strict restriction on the appeals it will allow.\footnote{See the \cite[30-4]{da05}.} It typically only hears cases when a matter of principle is at stake, or when the law is thought to be in need of clarification.\footnote{See generally \cite{skoghoy08}.}

The Norwegian legal system is often said to be based on a special ``Scandinavian'' variety of civil law, which includes strong common law elements: Legislation is not typically as detailed as elsewhere in continental Europe, some legal areas lack a firm legislative basis,  it is generally accepted that courts develop the law, and the opinions of the Supreme Court are considered crucial to the legislative interpretation of the lower courts.\footnote{See generally \cite{bernitz07}.} At the same time, legislation remains the primary source that is used to resolve most legal disputes. Moreover, when applying the law, the courts tend to place great weight on preparatory documents procured by the executive branch. These documents, in particular, are widely regarded as expressions of legislative intent.\footnote{However, in light of how the legislative process is usually organised, it is probably fair to say that these documents tend to demonstrate the intent of the executive, not necessarily the Storting.}

The Constitution of Norway dates back to 1814 and was heavily influenced by contemporaneous political movements in the US and France. Moreover, it was influenced by a desire for self-determination, as Noway was at that time a part of Dennmark. Following the Napoleonic wars, the Norwegian political elite fought to secure independence, but in the end, Norway was forced to enter into a union with Sweden. However, the Constitution remained in place, and after the triumph of parliamentary system in 1884, Norway would also eventually gain independence, in 1905.

During the 19th century, the Norwegian farmers emerged as a powerful group in Norwegian politics. This, it is commonly held, was in large part due to the fact that they were also landowners, whose rights and contributions were not limited to traditional farming.\footnote{The ``classic'' presentation of the political influence of farmers in Norway is \cite{koht26}.} Importantly, Norwegian farmers had a significant voice in the management of land rights and resources in general. The feudal tradition was never as strong in Norway as elsewhere in Europe.\footnote{See \cite[59-60]{pryser99}.}

The majority of Norwegian farmers were tenants in the 17th century, but they generally enjoyed better protection against abuse. In addition, the remoteness of many rural communities and the challenging natural environment meant that large feudal estates could hardly operate effectively without granting much autonomy to local farmers. Moreover, the black death had severely taken its toll on the population in Norway, wiping out entire communities, including the feudal elites and the social and physical infrastructure that sustained them. It should be noted that this is also considered an important reason why Dennmark could dominate Norway, and hold on to it as long as they did.\footnote{The origins of Dennmark-Norway was the so-called Kalmar union, which also included Sweden. Initially, Norway took part on relatively equal footing with Sweden and Dennmark. Later, however, after Sweden left the union, Dennmark developed a much stronger position than Norway.}

Later, when the Danish-Norwegian nobility fell into a fiscal crisis in the 18th century, farmers in Norway began to buy land from their landlords, including the non-arable land surrounding their farms.\footnote{See \cite[59-60]{pryser99}.} As a result, Norwegian farmers were no longer tenants, not even in name, and the distribution of land ownership in Norway became quite egalitarian. It is worth noting that farmers would typically join forces to purchase shares of larger estates. They would acquire sole ownership over their own house and cultivated ground, while becoming co-owners of the surrounding land, alongside other local farmers. Hence, many resources attached to land came to be owned jointly by several members of the local community. In addition, farmers would also often partition their land further, for instance to make room for younger sons to set up their own farms. As a result, Norway became a society were land ownership was not a privilege for the few, but held by the many, at least compared to feudal Europe.

In 1814, the landed nobility in Norway was further marginalised. Indeed, the Constitution itself prohibited the establishment of new noble titles and estates.\footcite[23|118]{c14} Then, in 1821, all hereditary titles were abolished (although existing nobles kept their titles for their lifetimes).\footnote{See `Lov, angaaende Modificationer og nærmere Bestemmelser af den Norske Adels Rettigheder' (Act of August 1 1821).} By the mid 19th century, ordinary farmers had gained even greater political influence. In fact, they emerged as the leading political class, alongside the city bureaucrats.\footnote{See generally \cite{hommerstad14}.} During this time, Norway also introduced a system of powerful local municipalities. These were organised as representative democracies, becoming miniature versions of the cherished, as of yet unfulfilled, nation state (Norway was still in a union with Sweden at this time). Even today, municipalities retain a great deal of power in Norway, particular in relation to land use planning.\footnote{They are the primary decision-maker for spatial planning, as pursuant to \cite{pb08}.} They represent a highly decentralised political structure, with a total of 428 municipalities in force as of 01 January 2013. \footnote{This is down from the all-time high of 747 in 1930. There have long been proposals to reduce the number of municipalities further, but so far the political resistance against this has prevented major reforms. See \url{https://www.regjeringen.no/nb/tema/kommuner-og-regioner/kommunereform/} (report to the Ministry from an expert committee on municipality reform, 2014).}

As an aspect of ownership over the land, control of water resources was particularly important to the farmers of Norway. According to Terje Tvedt, 10 000 - 30 000 mills were in operation in Norway in 1830s.\footnote{See \cite[121]{tvedt13}.} As he argues, the fact that these mills were under local control, was particularly important as it helped ensure self-sufficiency. In addition, saw mills became an important source of extra income for Norwegian farming communities. While some of the larger mills were controlled and operated on behalf of non-local owners, most of them were run by the farmers themselves. Indeed, even during feudal times tenant farmers often made the case that their tenancy entitled them to engage also in the saw mill and timber industry.

Today, the importance of water is clearly felt throughout Norwegian society. This is so not only because water is the main source of domestic energy, or because local owners may be able to develop hydropower for financial gain. It is also undeniably the case that water occupies a special place in Norwegian culture. It is important to the identity of many communities, particularly in the western part of the country, where majestic waterfalls are important symbols both of the hardship of the natural conditions and the sturdiness of local people. One particular aspect of this, with concrete financial implications, is that waterfalls are an important asset to Norwegian tourism. The so-called ``Norway in a nutshell'' tours, for instance, have become greatly popular, based on delivering access to wild and unspoilt nature, with fjords, waterfalls, idyllic villages, and railway lines that seem to defy gravity.\footnote{See \url{http://www.norwaynutshell.com/en/explore-the-fjords/}.}

This all speaks to the fact that water resources is embedded in the social fabric in such a way that a narrow view on the rights and entitlements that arise in relation to them is destined to failure. Hence, the case of Norwegian waterfalls is particularly suited to an investigation based on a social function view on property. Moreover, waterfalls serve to bring out tensions between rights and obligations in this regard, while also shedding light on the question of how to organise decision-making processes regarding property.

In the next section, I will argue that the present law on water in Norway tends to recognise only a small part of the relevant picture. On the one hand, it recognises the financial entitlements of owners, which it tries to balance against the regulatory needs of the state. But it largely fails to take into account that owners also have broader interests, even obligations, relating to waterfalls. Moreover, I will set out to show that the law fails to take into account that commercial interests can exert a strong pull on various state bodies, particularly those that are only weakly grounded in democratic decision-making processes. 

As a result, I believe the current narrative on this issue in Norway, particularly among the elites, is based on a false dichotomy, which puts the interests of ``profit-maximising'' owners, acting out of self-interest, against the interests of a ``benevolent'' state, acting for the common good. In the following, I will present the legal framework in more depth, aiming also to substantiate my claims further.

\section{Hydropower in the Law}\label{sec:hl}

Under Norwegian law, waterfalls are regarded as private property. The system is riparian, so by default, a waterfall belongs to the owner of the land over which the water flows.\footnote{See the \cite[13]{wra00}.} This does not mean that the landowners own the water as such -- freely running water is not subject to ownership -- but it entitles the owner of the waterfall to harness the potential energy in the water over the stretch of riverbed belonging to him. This right can be partitioned off from any rights in the surrounding land, and large scale hydropower schemes typically involve such a separation of water rights from land rights, giving the energy company the right to harness the energy, while the local landowners retain ownership of the surrounding land.

Norwegian rivers, and especially rivers suitable for hydropower schemes, tend to run across grazing land owned jointly by farmers, so rights to waterfalls are typically held among several members of the local, rural community.\footnote{Much land in Norway is jointly owned by groups of local farmers, see, e.g., \cite[570]{stenseth07}. Moreover, rivers tend to run through land that has not to been enclosed, and in cases where there has been a land enclosure, water rights are often explicitly left out, such that they are still considered jointly owned rights, belonging to the community of local farmers.} Such original owners might not always be willing to give up their ownership to facilitate development, especially not on the terms proposed by the developer. However, the hydropower sector was traditionally regulated as a public sector monopoly, and local owners were rarely in a position to negotiate for better terms. The use of expropriation came to play an important role to Norwegian hydropower.

%This has meant that the terms governing separation of water-rights from land-rights, including the level of compensation paid to landowners, and the influence they are granted in the decision-making process, has been determined by the law. 

%Following legislation in the early 20th century, a regulatory system was put in place that centralized the management of Norwegian water resources. 

%It clearly favored exploitation by the state or by companies owned by local governmental bodies, and the local landowners were severely marginalized. In most cases, they would have to accept the terms presented to them by the developer, or else argue the matter in Court, after the developer had already been granted a license to expropriate. 

%Landowners were not in a good position to negotiate the terms of the development, and their property rights appeared increasingly nominal, the prevailing political attitude being that waterfalls formed part of the common heritage of the Norwegian people, and should be managed in their interest.\footnote{While some of the claims made here will be further qualified by what is to follow, the general picture we paint here is communicated also by the standard work on Norwegian water law \cite{falk}.}

This has resulted in a legal tension where, on the one hand, waterfalls are defined as private property, yet, on the other hand, they are also considered as belonging to the public. The following two quotes illustrate this ambivalence:\footnote{The first quote is taken from the general water law, with roots going back a thousand years to the so-called ``Gulating'' laws mentioned in Section \ref{sec:into3}. The second quote is taken from a law directed specifically at large-scale hydropower, introduced during the early days of the hydropower industry.}

{\begin{minipage}[t]{16em}
 \begin{aquote}{\tiny Section 13, Water Resources Act 2000} \footnotesize A river system belongs to the owner of the land it covers, unless otherwise dictated by special legal status. [...]

The owners on each side of a river system have equal rights in exploiting its hydropower.
\end{aquote}  
\end{minipage}}
{\begin{minipage}[t]{22em}
\begin{aquote}{\tiny Section 1, Industrial Concession Act 1917 (amended 2008)} \footnotesize Norwegian water resources belong to the general public and are to be managed in their interest. This is to be ensured by public ownership.
\end{aquote}
\end{minipage}} \\

As a consequence of liberalisation in the early 1990s, this tension in statute is now also of great practical significance, as owners who are interested in undertaking development themselves attempt to fend off developers wishing to expropriate their waterfalls. Hence, the question of how to manage the internal contradiction on ownership of water resources in Norwegian law has arisen with increasing force in recent years, resulting in several Supreme Court decisions. In the following, I present the most important legislation regarding hydropower development, aiming to bring out those aspects that are particularly relevant to the position of local owners and local communities.

%Before we delve into the details, we will elaborate a bit further on the context in which the law was called upon to function in this case. Importantly, the economic, social and political context of expropriation has changed rather dramatically in recent years.

%There are two developments that have been particularly important. First, there has been a general shift from viewing electricity production as a public service to viewing it as a commercial enterprise. This has made the legitimacy of expropriation appear more controversial, and the argument is often voiced that expropriation does not happen in the interest of the public at all, but \emph{solely} in order to benefit the commercial interests of particular companies.\footnote{This has been a recurring theme in articles appearing in "Småkraftnytt", the newsletter for "Småkraftforeninga", an interest organization for owners of small-scale hydro-power, which currently have 236 associated small scale hydro-power plants, see http://kraftverk.net/ (in Norwegian). In addition to the case of Måland, the question has also been brought before the (lower) national courts in some other cases, such as \emph{Sauda}, LG-2007-176723 (Gulating Lagmannsrett, regional high court), and \emph{Durmålskraft}, see http://www.ranablad.no/nyheter/article5583405.ece (decision from the district court, as reported in a Norwegian newspaper). In both cases, the outcome was generally more favorable to the expropriating party than the local owners, and the reasoning adopted by the courts appears similar to that of \emph{Måland}.}

%In this way, expropriation of Norwegian waterfalls raises issues that have become increasingly important also in a global setting, and which seem to arise naturally in systems where economic activities are organized based on public-private partnerships. In such systems, it seems practically inevitable that cases of expropriation -- undertaken to benefit the public -- will also often come to benefit developers that are motivated by purely commercial interests. While this in itself might not be problematic, it will easily lead to the concern that the commercial interests of powerful companies is the main reason why expropriation is permitted, and that expropriation is being used as a commercial tool for powerful market forces, to the detriment of less powerful actors.

%For the case of Norwegian waterfalls, however, liberalization of the energy sector has also had a positive effect for local communities, in that it has served to make local owners more active. It has become increasingly common that they exploit their hydro-power resources themselves, often in small scale projects, and often in cooperation with companies that specialize in such development.\footnote{In 2012, the NVE granted 125 new licenses for small scale hydro-power, and at the end of the year they had 859 applications still under consideration. Source: report made by the NVE, available at http://www.nve.no/Global/Energi/Q412\_ny\_energi\_tillatelser\_og\_utbygging.pdf (in Norwegian). } This, of course, only adds to the controversy surrounding expropriation of waterfalls, especially when local owners are deprived of the opportunity for small scale development.

\subsection{The Water Resources Act}\label{sec:wra00}

The act which sets out the basic rules regarding water management in Norway is the \cite{wra00}.\footnote{Act relating to river systems and groundwater of 24 November 2000 No. 82 (unofficial translation provided by the University of Oslo, \url{http://www.ub.uio.no/ujur/ulovdata/lov-20001124-082-eng.pdf}).} This act is not only concerned with hydropower, but regulates the use of river systems and groundwater generally.\footnote{See the \cite[1]{wra00}. A river system is defined as ``all stagnant or flowing surface water with a perennial flow, with appurtenant bottom and banks up to the highest ordinary floodwater level'', see \cite[2]{wra00}. Artificial watercourses with a perennial flow are also covered (excluding pipelines and tunnels), along with artificial reservoirs, in so far as they are directly connected to groundwater or a river system, see the \cite[2a-2b]{wra00}.} 

In s 8, the Act sets out the basic license requirement for anyone wishing to undertake measures in a river system.\footnote{Measures in a river system are defined as interventions that ``by their nature are apt to affect the rate of flow, water level, the bed of a river or direction or speed of the current or the physical or chemical water quality in a manner other than by pollution'', see the \cite[3a]{wra00}.} The main rule is that if such measures may be of ``appreciable harm or nuisance''  to public interests, then a license is required.\footnote{See the \cite[8]{wra00}. There are two exceptions, concerning measures to restore the course or depth of a river, and concerning the landowner's reasonable use of water for his permanent household or domestic animals, see the \cite[12|15]{wra00}.} Further rules regarding the licensing procedure is set out in Chapter 3 of the Act.

In s 18, it is made clear that the water authorities are competent to decide whether a given measure requires a license pursuant to s 8.\footnote{See \cite[18]{wra00}.}  Moreover, they are obliged to issue such a decision if the developer, an affected authority, or others with a legal interest, request it. In addition, they may prohibit implementation before the decision is reached. In relation to hydropower development, it is established practice that most hydropower projects over 1000 kw will be deemed to require a license.\footnote{See, e.g., \url{http://www.nve.no/no/Konsesjoner/Vannkraft/Konsesjonspliktvurdering/} (accessed 16 August 2014). Exceptions are possible, for instance projects that upgrade existing plants, or which utilise water between artificial reservoirs.}

The basic criteria for granting a license is formulated in such a way that a license ``may be granted only if the benefits of the measure outweigh the harm and nuisances to public and private interests affected in the river system or catchment area''.\footnote{See \cite[25]{wra00}.} Hence, it falls under the discretion of the water authorities to decide if a licence {\it should} be granted, if the condition is fulfilled. The courts may not censor the administrative decision in this regard.\footnote{This is an expression of the principle of ``freedom of discretion'' for the administrative branch, a fundamental tenet of Norwegian administrative law. See generally \cite[71-74]{eckhoff14}.}

The procedure that the water authorities follow in licensing cases is largely determined by regulation passed by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (MoPE) pursuant to s 65, and by administrative practice developed by the water authorities themselves.\footnote{I return to a presentation of administrative practice in Section \ref{sec:step}.} Many of the rules in \cite{paa67} also apply. However, these more general rules tend to play a minor role in practice compared to sector-specific administrative practices.\footnote{This was a point of contention in the Supreme Court case of \cite{jorpeland11}. The case is discussed and presented in depth in Chapter \ref{chap:4}, Section \ref{sec:jorpeland}.}

Only a few basic rules are encoded in the \cite{wra00} itself. This includes rules to ensure that the application is sufficiently documented, so that the authorities have enough information to assess its merits.\footnote{See \cite[23]{wra00}.} Moreover, a basic publication requirement is enforced, stating that applications are public documents and that the applicant is responsible for giving public notice. The intention is that interested parties should be given an opportunity to comment on the plans.\footnote{See \cite[24]{wra00}. There are some exceptions to the requirement to give public notice, however. It may be dropped in case it appears superfluous, or if the application must be rejected or postponed, see \cite[24a-24c]{wra00}.} More detailed rules for public notice of applications are given in s 27-1 of the \cite{pb08}, which also applies with regards to licenses under the \cite[8]{wra00}.

Furthermore, an important rule of principle is given in s 22, regarding the relationship between applications for licenses and governmental ``master plans'' for the use or protection of river systems in a greater area. These plans have no clear legislative basis, but were introduced through parliamentary action in the 1980s, when the Storting decided to initiate such planning in an effort to introduce a more holistic basis for assessment of licensing applications.\footnote{Today, the planning authority is delegated to the Directorate of Natural Preservation and the NVE, with the system being scheduled for reform as a consequence of Norway's implementation of the water directive of the European Union. See } According to s 22 of the \cite{wra00}, if a river system falls within the scope of a master plan that is under preparation, an application to undertake measures in this river system may be delayed or rejected without further consideration.\footnote{See \cite[22]{wra00}, first paragraph.} Second, a license may only be granted if the measure is without appreciable importance to the plan.\footnote{See \cite[22]{wra00}, first paragraph.} In addition, once a plan has been completed, the processing of applications is to be based on it, meaning that an application which is at odds with some master plan may be rejected without further consideration.\footnote{See \cite[22]{wra00}, second paragraph.} It is still possible to obtain a license for such a project, but if it results in less hydropower than the use indicated by the plan, s 22 indicates that only the Ministry may grant it.\footnote{See \cite[22]{wra00}, second paragraph.}

The rules considered so far all apply to any measures in river systems, not only hydropower projects. Many special procedures apply to hydropower cases, but most of these have been developed through administrative practice. Some are also provided for in other statutory provisions. In s 19, the relationship between the \cite{wra00} and the \cite{wra00} is described. The latter act is specifically aimed at a certain subgroup of hydropower schemes, namely those that involve regulation of a watercourse.\footnote{See Section \ref{sec:wra17} below.} However, according to s 19 of the \cite{wra00}, many of the rules from the \cite{wra17} also apply to unregulated, run-of-river, hydropower schemes, if they generate more than 40 GWh/year.\footnote{See \cite[19]{wra00}}. In the next section, I will present these rules in more detail.

\subsection{The Watercourse Regulation Act}\label{sec:wra17}

In order to maximise the output of a hydropower scheme, the flow of water may be regulated using dams or diversions. Regulation was particularly important in the early days of hydropower, before the national electricity grid was developed. Consumers did not want to pay for more energy than they needed when the flow was high, and they wanted to avoid power cuts in periods of drought. At this time, a few local hydropower plants were typically the only sources of electricity in any given area. This meant that regulation of the waterflow was needed to even out the level of output, otherwise the electricity supply would be unstable. Indeed, in the early days, it was common for electricity producers to get paid based on the stable effect they were able to deliver, rather than the total amount of energy they harnessed.

This changed with the development of a wide-ranging electricity grid, which allowed electricity to be imported and exported between different geographical areas depending on the levels of output from those areas.\footnote{See generally \cite{sofienlund07}.} Today, producers get paid based on the total amount of electricity produced, measured in kilowatt hours (KWh). The price fluctuates over the year, and the supply-side is still influenced by instability in the waterflow in Norwegian rivers. However, the smoothing effect of the national grid means that run-of-river schemes can be carried out profitably, even if the majority of electricity is produced during peak production periods. They are also often regarded as less environmentally controversial, since they don't disturb the flow of water to the same extent as a project involving regulation. In addition, due to technological advances, the kinds of generators needed to exploit fluctuating levels of water have become much cheaper. 

Despite the growing importance of run-of-river scheme, many key rules regarding all kinds of hydropower are found in the \cite{wra17}.\footnote{Act relating to the regulation of watercourses of 14 December 1917 No. 17.} The Act defines regulations as ``installations or other measures for regulating a watercourse's rate of flow''. It also explicitly states that this covers installations that ``increase the rate of flow by diverting water''.\footnote{See \cite[1]{wra17}.} The core rule of the Act is that watercourse regulations that affect the rate of flow of water above a certain threshold are subject to a special licensing requirement.\footnote{See \cite[2]{wra17}.} The threshold is defined in terms of the notion of a ``natural horsepower''. 

I will return to this notion briefly below. For now, it suffices to say that most watercourse regulations undertaken in the context of hydropower development will indeed require a special license. In addition, as I mentioned above, the \cite{wra00} stipulates that many rules in the \cite{wra17} apply to any hydropower scheme that will generate more than 40 GWh annually.\footnote{See \cite[19]{wra00}.}

The criteria for granting a regulation license are similar to those for granting a license pursuant to the \cite{wra00}. In particular, s 8 of the \cite{wra17} states that a license should ordinarily be issued only if the benefits of the regulation are deemed to outweigh the harm or inconvenience to public or private interests.\footnote{See \cite[8]{wra17}.} In addition, it is made clear that other deleterious or beneficial effects of importance to society should be taken into account.\footnote{See \cite[8]{wra17}.} Finally, if an application is rejected, the applicant can demand that the decision is submitted for review by the Storting.\footnote{See \cite[8]{wra17}.}

The \cite{wra17} contains more detailed rules regarding the procedure for dealing with license applications. The most practically important is that the applicant is obliged to organise an impact assessment pursuant to the \cite{pb08}.\footnote{Act no 71 of 27 June 2008 relating to Planning and Building Applications.} This means that the applicant must organise a hearing, and submit a detailed report on positive and negative effects of the development, prior to submitting a formal application for development. Effectively, {\it two} detailed assessments of the merits of the project are required. 

However, as I discuss in more depth in Section \ref{sec:step} below, impact assessments tend to focus on environmental issues as well as broader societal consequences. The local perspective, and the immediate effects of development on local owners, is usually not a primary concern. In addition to prescribing impact assessments, the \cite{wra17} contains more specific rules concerning the second public hearing that should take place, when the application as such is assessed. 

First, the applicant should make sure that the application is submitted to the affected municipalities and other interested government bodies.\footcite[6]{wra17} Second, the applicant should send the application to organisations, associations and the like whose interests are ``particularly affected''.\footcite[6]{wra17} Along with the application, these interested parties should be given notification of the deadline for submitting comments, which should not be less than three months.\footnote{See \cite[6]{wra17}.} The applicant is also obliged to announce the plans, along with information about the deadline for comments, in at least one commonly read newspaper, as well as the Norwegian Official Journal.\footnote{\cite[6]{wra17}. The Norwegian Official Journal is the state's own announcement periodical.} In so far as the water authorities find it ``reasonable'', the applicant is also obliged to compensate landowners and other interested parties for expenses accrued in relation to legal and expert assistance sought in relation to the application.\footcite[6]{wra17}

A license pursuant to the \cite{wra17} might be cumbersome to obtain, but a successful application also results in a significant benefit. Most importantly, the license holder then automatically has a right to expropriate the necessary rights needed to undertake the project, including the right to inconvenience other owners.\footnote{See \cite[16]{wra17}.} 

One may ask whether this approach, making expropriation a side-effect of a regulation license, is a legitimate manner in which to organise interference in property rights. It is clear that the issue of expropriation rarely receives separate treatment in regulation cases. In particular, the assessment undertaken by the water authorities is focused on the licensing issue, which does not compel them to direct any special attention towards owners' interests.\footnote{I demonstrate this, and discuss it in much more depth, in Chapter \ref{chap:4}, Section \ref{sec:jorpeland}.}

In general, the issue of who owns and controls the water resources in question receives little attention in relation to licensing applications, both pursuant to the \cite{wra17} and the \cite{wra00}. Instead, the focus is on weighing environmental interests against the public's interest in electricity and economic development. The issue of resource ownership comes up in relation to a third important statute, however, namely the  \cite{ica17}.

\subsection{The Industrial Licensing Act}\label{sec:ica17}

In the early 20th century, industrial advances meant that Norwegian waterfalls became increasingly interesting as objects of foreign investment. To maintain national control of water resources, parliament passed an act in 1909 that made it impossible to purchase valuable waterfalls without a special license. The follow-up to this act is the \cite{ica17}, which is still in force.\footnote{Act relating to acquisition of waterfalls, mines, etc. of 14 December 1917 No. 16.} It applies to the purchase or lease of waterfalls that may be exploited to that they yield more than 4000 natural horsepowers.

In practice, this means that the Act does not apply to many run-of-river hydropower schemes, even large-scale projects. Even some regulation schemes fall outside the scope of the \cite{ica17}, although most large-scale regulation schemes are covered.

Originally, the main rule in the \cite{ica17} stated that all licenses granted to private parties were time-limited, and that the waterfalls would become state property without compensation when they expired, after at most 60 years.\footnote{See the old \cite[2]{ica17}, in force before the amendment on 26 September 2008.} This was known as the rule of {\it reversion} in Norwegian law (a misnomer, since most waterfalls were originally owned by local peasants, not the state).

In a famous Supreme Court case of 1918, the rule was upheld after having been challenged by owners on constitutional grounds.\footnote{See \cite{johansen18}.} I return to this decision in some more depth in Chapter \ref{chap:4}, but mention here that the main conclusion in this case was that the rule of reversion represented a form of regulation of property, not expropriation, and that this did not give rise to any constitutional claims, even if the owners were not awarded compensation.

While the rule of reversion withstood internal challenges, it was eventually struck down by the EFTA Court in 2007, as a breach of the EEA agreement.\footnote{See \cite{efta07}. The EEA (European Economic Area) agreement sets up a framework for the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital between Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein and the European Union. The EFTA (European Free Trade Association) oversees the implementation of the EEA for those members of EFTA that are also members of the EEA (all except Switzerland). For further details, see generally \cite{bull94,magnussen02,fredriksen09}.} This conclusion was fuelled by the fact that reversion only applied to privately owned companies, so that it represented a form of discrimination. After this ruling, the \cite{ica17} was amended. Today, only companies where the state controls more than 2/3 of the shares may purchase waterfalls to which the Act applies.\footnote{See the \cite[2]{ica17}.}

This means that such waterfalls can only be bought, leased or expropriated by companies in which the state is a majority shareholder. In practice, however, landowners are still able to sell the land from which the right to the waterfall originates, even if this also means transferring the waterfalls to a new owner. The rule is only enforced when waterfalls as such are transferred, specifically for the purpose of hydropower development. Moreover, local owners may in theory still develop hydropower in waterfalls that fall under the Act, since they already own them. But this would be difficult in practice if they are denied permission to partition the water rights off from the surrounding land, to make them available as stand-alone security for debt commitments. In effect, local owners would have a hard time acquiring financing for projects in these waterfalls, particularly if they do not wish to put their entire land holdings down as security.

Moreover, if they succeed in acquiring financing, a development license would likely be hard to obtain. It is quite clear, in particular, that the Norwegian government takes the view that hydropower projects in waterfalls falling under the \cite{ica17} should only be undertaken by companies in which the state has at least 2/3 of the shares. Moreover, they do not seem to differentiate between development by outside commercial interests and development by local owners. 

For instance, in the ongoing case of {\it Sauland}, the local owners of a large waterfall wish to develop a project that would fall under the \cite{ica17}. At the same time, a large-scale development involving the same waterfall is planned by a company in which the state owns more than 2/3 of the shares. The case is still pending a final decision, but the water authorities have stated their unwillingness to assess any licensing application from the local owners, unless they ensure that the state takes up at least a 2/3 stake in the development.\footnote{Source: NVE (\url{www.nve.no}).}

In this case, the authorities use s 2 of the \cite{ica17} to deprive the owners of control over the development of their waterfalls. This, moreover, would hardly be regarded as expropriation under Norwegian law. Hence, it would likely not result in an obligation to pay compensation to original owners. The question is whether the government acted in accordance with the \cite{ica17} in this case, or extended its scope in an illegitimate way. After all, the project that the water authorities refused to consider did not in fact involve transferring control over the waterfalls to any new, non-local, owners. 

The question of how to apply the \cite{ica17} in this situation has not yet been clarified by the courts. If local owners may be deprived of the development potential under the act, it also raises the further question of what the consequences will be for the level of compensation when this development potential is subsequently transferred to a company in which the state controls more than 2/3 of the shares. If the initial deprivation is regarded as regulation rather than expropriation, it would seem to follow from general expropriation law that no compensation is payable for the hydropower potential, as it can no longer be said to represent a foreseeable source of income for the original owners. In this case, the \cite{ica17} would have the effect of allowing state-backed actors on the energy market to reassert their claim of cheap access to waterfalls through the use of expropriation.

The policy justification for the \cite{ica17} is based on the idea that giving preference to state-owned actors will protect the public interest in Norwegian hydropower. As quoted earlier, s 1 of the Act explicitly stipulates that the hydropower resource belongs to the public and should be managed in its interest. However, this perspective clashes with the fact that the electricity sector itself has been liberalised. The state may be a majority shareholder in the most powerful companies, but these companies are now run according to commercial principles, with little or no political involvement.

In the next section, I look at the basic legislation that sets up this system. I will argue that the preference given to companies where the state is a majority shareholder amount to little more than a symbolic nod to the public interest. On the other hand, it puts in place a system of systematic discrimination against smaller companies that do not have state backing. This attains practical significance internally on the market, since the most powerful actors are often in a position to gain advantages that run counter to the policy ideas that motivated the original move to liberalise the system.

\subsection{The Energy Act}\label{sec:ea}

Before 1990, the Norwegian energy sector was organised as a distributed monopoly.\footnote{See generally \cite{bye05,skjold07}.} There were several local monopolists, owned and controlled by the state or the municipalities. These were held responsible for energy supply and distribution in their region. There was no real competition on the market, neither on the supply side nor on the demand side. In particular, the local monopolists could deny other energy producers access to the distribution grid.

At the same time, the system ensured that energy companies were more or less directly politically accountable. They were typically run by politically appointed boards, often organised as administrative bodies of local government. Moreover, they were not subject to commercial management principles that insulated them from the political discourse of the local area in which they operated.

This system was abandoned following the passage of the \cite{ea90}.\footnote{See generally \cite{bibow11}.} This Act set up a new regulatory framework, where management of the grid was decoupled from the hydropower production sector.\footnote{See generally \cite{bye05}.} In particular, the Act established a system whereby consumers could choose their electricity supplier freely. At the same time, the Act aimed to ensure that producers were granted non-discriminatory access to the electricity grid. This laid the groundwork for what has today become an international market for the sale of electricity, namely the NordPool.\footnote{See \url{http://www.nordpoolspot.com/About-us/}. See generally \cite{skjold07,galtung07}.}

In this way, the Energy Act served to establish a market where any actor, privately owned or otherwise, could supply electricity to the grid, and profit commercially from hydropower. In response to this, monopoly companies were reorganised, becoming commercial companies that were meant to compete against each other, and against new actors that entered the market.\footnote{See \cite{claes11}.} %The Norwegian state retained a significant stake as shareholders in energy companies, now often alongside private investors. Moreover, as seen in the previous section, Norwegian law continue to favour companies where a majority of the shares are held by the state. To this day, the largest and most influential companies remain under majority public ownership. 
%the recent EFTA Court case, Case E-2/06, \emph{EFTA Surveillance Authority v. The Kingdom of Norway}, EFTA Court Report 2007, p.164. Here, the Court considered the old Norwegian rule of \emph{reversion}, whereby a license to undertake certain large scale hydro-power schemes (strictly speaking, a license to acquire the waterfalls needed to undertake it) came with a special clause that the private developer had to give up ownership to the State after a fixed period of time. This clause was held to be in breach of the EEA agreement since it only applied to private companies. We remark that the Norwegian government responded to this with an amendment after which reversion no longer applies, but which stated that a license to acquire waterfalls for the purpose of such large scale schemes can not be given at all to any company in which private parties own more than 1/3 of the shares.} %The aim of liberalization in Norway was not to minimize state entitlements arising from the hydropower sector. Rather, the intention was restricted to giving consumers greater freedom in choosing their energy-supplier, as well as to enhance efficiency in the sector by introducing competition.\footnote{See for instance \cite{liberal}, which offers a comparative study of the liberalization of the energy sectors in Norway and the UK.} In practice, however, this means that the state is now expected to function as a regular shareholder, which directs its companies to be run according to principles of commercial governance. Indeed, this is to some extent even a legally enforced requirement, e.g., pursuant to the free trade and competition rules of the EEA agreement. 
As a result, the local and political grounding of the energy sector, which used to be ensured through decentralised municipal ownership, has been significantly weakened. In addition to commercialisation, the market-orientation of the sector has also lead to centralisation, as many of the locally grounded municipality companies have disappeared as a result of mergers and acquisitions.\footnote{Today, the 15 largest companies, largely controlled by the state and some prosperous city municipalities, own roughly 80\% of Norwegian hydropower, measured in terms of annual output. See \cite[28]{otprp61}. I remark that the process of consolidation started even before the market-oriented reform of the sector. In particular, from 1960 onwards there was a significant push towards centralisation, as the state became a more dominant actor in the hydropower sector. For the state's increasing influence on the sector generally, see \cite{skjold06,thue06b}.}

At the same time, the fact that any developer of hydropower is now entitled to connect to the national grid gives non-state actors a possibility of entering the Norwegian energy market. They may do so not merely as minority shareholders in state companies, but also as {\it competitors}. This has been especially important for local owners of waterfalls, since it makes owner-led development possible. 
In practice, however, the large actors in the hydropower sector still have many opportunities to block the aspirations of local owners, not least through the use of expropriation. I return to this in depth in the next chapter.

In the next section, I give a step-by-step presentation of the licensing procedure for hydropower, which serves to put the information presented in this and preceding sections into a dynamic context.

\noo{ The \cite{ea90} contains provisions that lay down basic rules regarding various kinds of licenses needed to construct and operate energy installations, including those needed for the development of hydropower. Usually, however, these licenses are not as controversial or hard to obtain as those pertaining directly to the hydropower plant itself. In addition, they raise no particular issues relating to expropriation or control over water resources, so I will not discuss them further in this thesis. Instead, I will now give a step-by-step description of the licensing procedure for hydropower development, to summarise and elucidate on the rules presented in this and preceding sections.
}
%By far the most important aspect of the act for hydropower development, particularly in cases when different parties are interested in carrying out development, concern the right to connect to the grid. However, this right can become illusory due to the fact that the local grid company -- a monopolist -- has the right to demand contributions from hydropower developers, in so far as the grid needs to be improved in order to handle the output from their hydropower schemes. 
%
%The size of the contribution required, and the technical basis for calculating it, is largely determined by the grid company itself. In many cases, the costs can become so great as to prohibit  profitable development. This can result in conflict, particularly in cases when the grid company is affiliated with a competing hydropower developer who has a commercial interest in preventing other developers from connecting to the local grid. This issue arises in many cases involving expropriation, as the beneficiary is often also the local grid monopolist. In effect, the taker of the waterfall is tasked with calculating the cost of connecting alternative, owner-led, projects to the grid, a crucial factor in determining the  compensation payable. I return to this issue in Chapter \ref{chap:5}. 
%
%In the next section, I consider a recent piece of legislation that creates an additional financial incentive for carrying out hydropower development, by introducing a certificate system to subsidize 
%environmentally friendly energy.
%
%%The most significant step towards liberalization of the Norwegian energy sector was made in 1990 when the Energy Act was passed, an important new piece of statute reorganizing the system for the distribution of electricity.\footnote{Act nr. 50 of 29 of June 1990 relating to the generation, conversion, transmission, trading, distribution and use of electricity.} 
%
%\subsection{Electricity Certificate Act}\label{eca11}
%
%In the 1960s and 70s, hydropower projects in Norway often sparked great controversy, with environmental groups in particular protesting what they saw as unjustifiable destruction of nature in the interest of economic development. Today, however, the environmental interests in hydropower are more divided. On the one hand, many still regard hydropower skeptically as destruction of nature. On the other hand, the increased focus on global warming has led many environmentalists to embrace hydropower as a renewable energy source.
%
%In 2011, the \cite{eca11} was passed, to set up a market for trade in so-called ``green energy'', which would effectively subsidize the further development of renewable energy, including hydropower.\footnote{Act relating to electricity certificates of
%24 June 2011 No. 39.} The basic building block of the new market is the electricity certificate, which will be issued to all renewable energy projects completed before 2020. The demand for such certificates is then created artificially, as the Act stipulates that energy suppliers and certain categories of end-users are required to purchase certificates based on their electricity consumption. 
%
%The Act sets up an incentive to develop hydropower, and it contributes significantly to the profitability of hydropower development.

\subsection{The Licensing Procedure}\label{sec:step}

The water authorities in Norway are centrally organised. The most important body is the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE), based in Oslo.\footnote{See \url{www.nvn.no}.} In many cases, the NVE have been delegated authority to grant development licenses themselves, but in case of large-scale development, they only prepare the case, then hand it over to the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy.\footnote{See delegation of 19 December 2000, from the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (FOR-2000-12-19-1705) and directive of 15 December 2000, from the King in Council (FOR-2000-12-15-1270), pursuant to \cite[64]{wra00}.} The Ministry, in turn, gives its recommendation to the King in Council, who makes the final decision.\footnote{See directive of 15 December 2000, from the King in Council (FOR-2000-12-15-1270).} As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:wra17}, parliament must also be consulted for regulations that will yield more than 20 000 natural horsepower.\footnote{See \cite[2]{wra17}.}

%The local municipalities are becoming increasingly marginalised in relation to hydropower management. Their role is usually limited to commenting on the plans, alongside other stakeholders. %At the same time, the \cite{pb08} does play an important role, but not in so far as , which normally grants significant authority to local %municipalities does play an important role. This is because projects over a given threshold requires an impact assessment (IA) to be carried out pursuant to section ..... 

As indicated by the survey of relevant legislation the previous sections, there are many categories of hydropower projects. Moreover, different categories call for different licenses. Hence, the first step in the application process is for the developer to determine exactly what kind of license they require. This is further complicated by the fact that some categories overlap, since they are based on different measuring sticks for assessing the scale of an hydropower project. 

One important parameter is the installed effect in the hydropower generator, measured in MW (Megawatts). There are four categories of hydropower formulated on this basis: the micro plants ($< 0.1$ MW), the mini plants ($< 1$ MW), the small-scale plants ($< 10$ MW), and the large-scale plants ($> 10$ MW). In practice, however, one tends to use small-scale hydropower to refer to all projects less than 10 MW. Still, a further qualification is sometimes required. For example, the authority to grant a license for a micro or mini plant has been delegated to the regional county councils since 2010, in an effort to reduce the queue of small-scale applications at the NVE.\footnote{See delegation letter from the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, dated 07 December 2009, available at \url{http://www.nve.no} (accessed 24 August 2014).} The council's decision is based on a (simplified) assessment made by the regional office of the NVE. In addition, licenses for micro and mini plants may be granted even in watercourses that have protected status pursuant to environmental law.\footnote{See Decision no 240, Stortinget (2004-2005), St.prp.nr.75 (2003-2004) and Innst.S.nr.116 (2004-2005).}

For small-scale plants proper, the authority to grant a license is delegated to the NVE, with the Ministry serving as an instance of appeal.\footnote{See delegation of 19 December 2000, from the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (FOR-2000-12-19-1705).} For large-scale plants, the granting authority is the King in Council, based on a recommendation from the Ministry.\footnote{See directive of 15 December 2000, from the King in Council (FOR-2000-12-15-1270).} However, in practice, the decision is usually closely based on assessments and recommendations provided by the NVE.\footnote{For a detailed guide to the administrative process for large-scale applications, published by the NVE, see \cite{stokker10}.}

While the relevant licensing authority depends on the effect of the planned plant, the kind of license required depends on a different categorisation, relating to the level of regulation in the planned project, measured in natural horsepower (NatHp). Here, there are three categories: run-of-river schemes  ($< 500$ NatHp), non-industrial regulations ($< 4000$ NatHp), and industrial regulations ($> 4000$ NatHp).\footnote{See \cite[2]{wra17} and \cite[1,2]{ica17}.} % 20 000 NatHp), and the very large regulations (> 20 000 NatHp). 

Almost all hydropower schemes require a license pursuant to the \cite[8]{wra00}.\footnote{As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:hl}, the exceptions are very small schemes (usually mini or micro) that are deemed to be relatively uncontroversial. Such schemes only require a license pursuant to the \cite{pb08}.} For run-of-river schemes, no further licenses are required for the development itself, although an operating license pursuant to the \cite{ea90} is typically required for the electrical installations. For schemes involving a non-industrial regulation, an additional license pursuant to the \cite[8]{wra17} is required. Industrial regulation schemes require yet another license, pursuant to the \cite[2]{ica17}.

As is to be expected, the complexity of the licensing procedure tends to increase with the number of different licenses required. However, the licensing applications tend to be dealt with in parallel, so that all licenses are granted at the same time, following a unified assessment. In practice, when the \cite{wra17} applies, it structures the procedure as a whole, also those aspects that pertain to other licenses. In addition, yet another categorisation of hydropower schemes is used to determine the relevant application procedure.

This categorisation is based on the annual production of the proposed plant, measured in GWh/year. There are three categories: simple schemes ($< 30$ GWh/year), intermediate schemes ($< 40$ GWh/year), and complicated schemes ($> 40$ GWh/year). For complicated schemes, the most important rules in \cite{wra17} applies, regardless of whether or not the scheme involves a regulation.\footnote{See \cite[19]{wra00}.} In addition, applications for such schemes must be accompanied by an impact assessment pursuant to the \cite[14-6]{pb08}.

This means that the applicant is required to organise a public hearing prior to submitting his formal application, to collect opinions on the project and provide an overview of benefits and negative effects of the plans, particularly as they relate to environmental concerns.\footnote{See directive of 19 December 2014 (FOR-2014-12-19-1758), pursuant to the \cite[1-2,14-6]{pb08}.} In practice, if an impact assessment is required this significantly increased the scope and complexity of the application processing.

For intermediate schemes that do not involve regulation, the rules in \cite{wra17} do not apply. However, impact assessments {\it may} still be required.\footnote{See \cite[20]{stokker10}. The threshold of 30 GWh/year has been set by the NVE, who have been delegated a more general authority to require impact assessments for hydropower projects even when these yield less than 40 GWh/year. See directive of 19 December 2014 (FOR-2014-12-19-1758).} This is determined by the NVE after a concrete assessment. For simple schemes, impact assessments are in not required. Such schemes make up the core of what is described as small-scale hydropower in daily language.

The time from application to decision can vary widely, depending on the complexity of the case, the level of controversy it raises, and the priority it receives by the licensing authority. Usually, the assessment stage itself will last 1-3 years, sometimes longer.\footnote{See \cite[84-85]{nou129}.} While large-scale schemes involve more complicated procedures, they are also typically given higher priority than small-scale schemes. In recent years, following the surge of interest of small-scale development, a processing queue has formed at the NVE.\footnote{See \cite[84]{nou129}.} This means that small-scale applications typically have to wait a long time, sometimes several years, before the NVE begins processing them.\footnote{See \cite[84]{nou129}.}

%
%
%The first step in the hydropower application process is for the developer to determine exactly what kind of license he requires. Roughly speaking, the Norwegian system operates with five different categories of hydropower development, for which different kinds of licences are required.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Concession free schemes: Projects that the water authorities regard as relatively uncontroversial from a water management perspective. If a developer obtains permission from the NVE to develop a concession free scheme, he does not require any licenses from the NVE. A regular planning permission from the local municipality will suffice.
%\item Small-scale schemes: Projects that require a special development licencse from the water authorities, pursuant to the \cite{wra00}, but such that section ... of that Act does no apply. This means, in particular, that the licence can be given without regard to the rules in the \cite{wra17}. In addition, the NVE have been delegated power to make the final decision in such ases, and they usually do so.
%\item Large-scale schemes: Projects that fall under the \cite{wra00}, but in such a way that section .... applies. This means that several sections of the \cite{wra17} applies, even though the scheme does not need a seperate reguation licence. It is more uncommon for the NVE to make the final decision in these cases. They are usually looked at by the Department of Oil and Enery, and concession is granted by the King in Council. 
%\item Regulation schemes: Projects that require a regulation licence pursuant to the \cite{wra17}. These projects also require a license pursuant to the \cite{wra00}, but the regulation license is usually considered the main issue in such cases. The rules of {\it reversion} apply to these cases, meaning that (some of) the hydropower installations fall to public ownership without compensation after a fixed number of years, usually 60.
%\item Industrial concession schemes: These projects are almost always large-scale and often also regulation schemes. In addition, they are deemed to be so important that they fall under the \cite{ica17}. This means that a special licence is required already for the development compant to acquire the necessary rights in the waterfall, either by purchase, a lease, or expropriation. A license will not be granted unless the public owns at least 2/3 of the shares in the development company.

%watercourse regulation, as provided for in the Watercourse Regulation Act of 1917, Section 8.\footnote{Act No. 17 of 14 December 1917 relating to Regulations of Watercourses.} As is customary, the application also included an application for a license to acquire waterfalls, as set out in the Industrial Concession Act, and a right to expropriate necessary rights from local owners, as provided for in the Water Resources Act, Section 51 and the Expropriation Act, Section 2 nr. 51.\footnote{Act No. 16 of 14 December 1917 relating to Acquisition of Waterfalls, Mines and other Real Property, Act No. 82 of 24 November 2000 relating to River Systems and Groundwater and Act No. 3 of 23 November 1959 relating to Expropriation.} In practice, it has not been common to consider such applications separately, but to consider the project as a whole, and to raise issues with respect to special provisions, and particular licenses, only in so far as they arise in connection with assessing the application for a development license, which is considered the main issue.

As I will discuss in more depth in the next chapter, the issue of expropriation is rarely given special attention during the application assessment. This is so even in cases when an application to expropriate waterfalls is submitted alongside the licensing application. The issue of expropriation is rarely singled out for special treatment, at least not in cases of large-scale development. Moreover, as mentioned in Section \ref{sec:hl}, an automatic right to expropriate follows from the \cite[16]{wra17}.

This rule is not understood to cover waterfalls, but it {\it is} understood to cover the right to divert water away from river systems where the applicant has no waterfall rights.\footnote{See \cite{jorpeland11}.} This is a {\it de facto} expropriation of waterfalls, and it is recognised as such in relation to the issue of compensation. However, it does not count as expropriation of a waterfall, meaning that no special expropriation permission is required. Recently, the Supreme Court held that this also implies that the special procedural rules that apply to expropriation do not apply.\footnote{See \cite{jorpeland11}.} Rather, the procedural rules and practices related to the development license are considered exhaustive.

These rules and practices pay little attention to the interests of local owners and the immediate local community. Usually, the only locally grounded actor that is recognised as playing an active role in the process is the municipality. However, even the role of the municipality is limited. Once a license is granted according to a sector-specific statute, no regular planning license needs to be obtained from the municipality.\footnote{See \cite[12-1]{pb08}.} Hence, the municipalities do not in fact enjoy any substantial decision-making power in hydropower cases. 

Still, the municipalities must be notified of any application that might affect their interests, and they are expected to express their views.\footnote{See \cite[8]{wra17} and \cite[24]{wra00}.} In addition, they may protest against the plans using a form of objection that requires the NVE to enter into dialogue with them about possible changes and improvements.\footnote{See \cite[5-4,5-6]{pb08}, c.f., \cite[24]{wra00}.} However, even if an agreement is not reached, a license can still be approved, although then always by the Ministry, not the NVE.\footnote{See \cite[5-6]{pb08}.}

The local owners are in a weaker position. In fact, the NVE is not even obliged to notify them of licensing applications concerning their waterfalls. Instead, the NVE expects the applicant to notify affected owners when submitting a license application. But it is not established practice for the NVE to do so on its own accord, or to check that the applicant has fulfilled its obligation in this regard.\footnote{See \cite{jorpeland11}, and the discussion in Chapter \ref{chap:4}, Section \ref{sec:jorpeland}.} More generally, the expropriating party that is responsible for managing several aspects of the assessment process, including in cases that involve expropriation.\footnote{This follows from the extensive extent to which the applicants themselves are expected to organise and retrieve the information that forms the basis of the administrative decision. In particular, the water authorities rarely conduct extensive independent investigations, meaning that the information provided by the applicant tends to dominate. This is implicit already in \cite{stokker10}. For a concrete example of its effect in expropriation cases, I refer to \cite{jorpeland11} and the detailed assessment of this case offered in the next chapter.}

One might think that this would raise competency questions. After all, applicants effectively acts as case workers on their own expropriation applications. However, it is established practice for the NVE to delegate much of the responsibility for preparing licensing cases to applicants, a practice that the Supreme Court has held to be beyond reproach.\footnote{See \cite{jorpeland11}.}

In cases that fall under the \cite{wra17}, the NVE must send its recommendation to the Ministry to interested parties for comments.\footnote{See \cite[6]{wra17}.} However, it is established practice that local owners do not count among the interested parties in this regard.\footnote{See \cite{jorpeland11}.} This includes owners of those waterfalls that the applicant wishes to expropriate. Hence, while the municipalities and various environmental interest groups are informed of how the case progresses and asked to comment on specific points prior to the final decision, the owners must inquire on their own accord if they wish to be kept up to date on the application process.

The lack of procedural safeguards protecting the interests of local owners is reflected in the kind of assessments that tend to be carried out. It is typical, in particular, for these assessments to focus primarily on the benefit of increased electricity production weighed against the negative effects on the natural environment. This, indeed, is the perspective that permeates the whole system, from the rules setting out the expected content of applications, through the procedures followed when assessing cases, on towards the criteria used to determine if licenses should be granted.\footnote{See \cite{stokker10}.} This also influences which voices receive attention. Great significance is attached to the opinions of environmental groups and expert agencies, while the owners' typically struggle to make an impact.\footnote{See \cite{jorpeland11}.}

To sum up, hydropower cases are assessed from within an expert-based system of governance, which also relies heavily on data that is collected and presented by the applicant. Political voices tend to remain distant. Municipality companies have been replaced by commercial actors on the applicant side, while the most important administrative decision-maker, the NVE, is a centralised, expert-based, directorate.

This is the procedural context of Norwegian hydropower, entrenched in law. In the next section, I will shift attention towards practical reality, focusing on the changes that resulted from the liberalisation reform of the early 1990s. I will begin by considering the established part of the sector, by presenting the ownership and management structures surrounding large-scale plants and the management of the national grid. Then I go on to consider specifically the surge of interest in small-scale hydropower, which represents an important counterweight to the process of centralisation and depoliticisation that has followed in the wake of the reform.

%For the local owners of waterfalls, the situation is worse, since they are not identified as stakeholders in large scale projects. They are not, in particular, mentioned in the Watercourse Regulation Act, Section 6, which regulates the steps that must be taken when preparing such cases.\footnote{Nor do the seem to be mentioned  in any of the documents setting out how the authorities deal with such cases in practice. See, for instance, the guide published by NVE \cite{rettleiar} (in Norwegian), directed at applicants, and setting out how NVE deals with cases involving large scale hydro-power.} Consequently, it is hardly surprising that in administrative practice, it has been uncommon to devote particular attention to local owners. Rather, the focus has typically been on environmental issues and the opinions of various interest groups, such as hunter or fishermen's associations.\footnote{For a more in depth account of the process, we point to the standard legal reference on Norwegian water law \cite{falk}(in Norwegian).}

\section{Hydropower in Practice}

The history of hydropower in Norway can be roughly divided into four stages. The first stage was the development that took place prior to 1909. During this time, private actors dominated, with public ownership playing a minor role.\footnote{See \cite{otprp61}.} In fact, in the early days on Norwegian hydro-power, in the first half of the 20th century, there were quite a few locally owned and operated power plants, often providing local communities with electricity. In addition to this, there were many private interests speculating in acquiring Norwegian waterfalls, anticipating the value that these would have for industrial development. 

After 1909, the introduction of licensing obligations and the rule of reversion meant that the state gained increased control over Norwegian water resources. At the same time, local municipalities began to invest in hydropower to provide electricity to its citizens, a service they were increasingly regarded as being obliged to provide.\footnote{See \cite{otprp61}.} This marked the start of the second stage of hydropower development, which saw the development of a monopolised, but decentralised, structure of municipality companies.

The third stage of hydropower came after the Second World War, when the central government began to invest heavily in hydropower, alongside municipality-owned companies. This period saw further marginalisation of private companies, as well as local owners. To increase the cost-effectiveness of the companies responsible for providing electricity to the public, it was often demanded, as a condition for allowing local communities access to the grid, that local hydropower plants had to be shut down.\footnote{See \cite[p.111]{hindrum94}.} During this time, the development of hydropower was seen as an important aspect of rebuilding the nation, a task carried out in the public interest.

The fourth state of hydropower development began in 1990 after the passage of the \cite{ea90}. The liberalisation that followed saw the transformation of the hydropower sector into a commercial market, based on profit-maximising and competition. As a result, the structure of decentralised management withered away further, as the municipality companies were either bought up by more commercially aggressive actors or forced to merge and change their business practices in order to remain competitive. At the same time, however, a new decentralised force emerged in the sector, in the form of local owner-led projects. 

%While private, these actors are not comparable to the industrial speculators that prompted the legislative response in the early 20th century. Rather, they arose as a reflection of the egalitarian system of land ownership in Norway, carrying forward an ancient tradition of local control over water resources that had been temporarily superseded by the political legitimacy of local municipalities.  
%As mentioned, owners of waterfalls are typically groups of ordinary local residents, most often farmers. With farming on the decline in Norway, particularly in those parts rich in water power, this development represents a chance for rejuvenation for rural communities. 

The core idea behind the \cite{ea90} was that the energy sector should be restructured in such a way that production and sale of electricity, activities deemed suitable for market regulation, would be kept organisationally separate from electricity distribution over the national grid, a natural monopoly. However, the Act itself does not explain in any depth how this is to be achieved, and in practice, the divide has not been very strictly implemented. In particular, most of the large energy companies in Norway continue to maintain interests in both distribution, production and sale of electricity, a phenomenon known as ``vertical integration''.\footnote{See \cite[580-583]{bibow03}.} In fact, since the liberalisation caused centralisation, the degree of vertical integration in the energy sector has increased since the passage of the \cite{ea90}.\footnote{See \cite[583]{bibow03}.}

The water authorities do try to respond to this, particularly by making use of their authority to give organisational directives when they grant distribution licenses.\footnote{See \cite[4-1]{ea90}, para 2, no 1.} Moreover, energy companies are required to keep separate accounts for production, distribution and sale of electricity.\footnote{See directive of 11 March 1999 (FOR-1999-03-11-302), s 4-4 a and s 2-6, issued by the NVE pursuant to directive of 7 December 1990 (FOR-1990-12-07-959), s 9-1, c.f, \cite[10-6]{ea90}.} It is also required that transactions across these functional divides are clearly marked, and that they are based on market prices.\footnote{See directive of 11 March 1999 (FOR-1999-03-11-302), s 2-8.} Moreover, the NVE serves a control function in this regard, as they review the accounts of distributors on an annual basis.\footnote{See directive of 11 March 1999 (FOR-1999-03-11-302), s 2-1.}

In practice, the water authorities have also gone further, by requiring that a separate company is set up to manage the distribution activities.\footnote{See \cite[581-582]{bibow03}.} However, it is permitted for this reorganisation to take place by formation of a conglomerate, under a single parent company that controls both the distribution company, the production company and the sales company. Indeed, this model has now been implemented by most of the large energy companies in Norway.\footcite[582]{bibow03}

It seems unclear whether this approach really achieves the stated objective. By adopting the conglomerate model of organisation, the major players on the market have successfully gained control over a larger share of both the production and distribution facilities for electricity. Hence, these actors effectively control the core infrastructure that makes up the backbone of the Norwegian energy sector. The {\it intention} is that monopoly power should only be exercised with respect to the distribution grid on strictly regulated, non-discriminatory, terms. But is this realistic when the same commercial players have significant stakes also in production and sale of electricity?

This question calls for a separate study, and I will not be able to address it in any depth here. However, I will direct attention at one aspect of this that arises with particular urgency for small-scale development of hydropower. It is quite common, in particular, that small-scale projects remain unrealised because the grid is regarded to lack sufficient capacity.\footnote{See, e.g., \cite[84,161-162]{nou129}.} Indeed, the distribution company is authorised to deny access in such cases, in keeping with their responsibility for providing an efficient and stable public service.\footnote{See \cite[3-4]{ea90}, c.f., directive of 7 December 1990 (FOR-1990-12-07-959), s 3-4.}

Often, the distribution company will be a sister company of an energy producer operating in direct competition with the company seeking access. This raises obvious questions about the impartiality of the assessments carried out by the distribution company. In expropriation cases, this tends to become a thorny issue, particularly in relation to the assessment of alternative development schemes. Waterfall owners are rarely pleased when they realise that the expropriating party is part of the same conglomerate as the grid company that estimates the grid connection costs associated with an owner-led development scheme. 

The water authorities themselves have recognised that access rights soon become illusory if it is too easy for the grid companies to deny access based on efficiency considerations.\footnote{See \cite{otprp62}.} At the same time, they point to the need for responsible management of the national grid, which, as they see it, requires delegation of authority to the grid companies. Hence, the authorities are left with a dilemma. So far, they have responded to this mainly by issuing more regulation, not by reducing the level of power-concentration in the energy sector.

The Energy Act was changed in 2009, such that grid companies are now subjected to a more wide-reaching duty to allow access for producers, even when this necessitates new investments.\footnote{See Act no 105 of 19 June 2009 regarding changes in the \cite{ea90}.} But who should pay, and how much? This is often unclear, and while the water authorities have a supervisory function, it is the grid companies themselves that determine this in the first instance.\footnote{See directive of 7 December 1990 (FOR-1990-12-07-959), s 3-4.} In addition, grid companies may still deny access in cases when the needed investments are not ``socio-economically rational''.\footnote{See \cite[3-4]{ea90}. The authority to decide whether this requirement is fulfilled is vested with the Ministry.} Hence, one may argue that the new rules only push the question of fairness and accountability further into the details of the decision-making process. Unsurprisingly, controversies continue to arise, particularly when owner-led and small-scale projects remain unfulfilled due to grid constraints.

%Functional division was only one of two core intentions behind the liberalization of the 1990s. The other aim, which has been fulfilled to a greater degree, was for centralization. Indeed, since 1990 there has been an unprecedented consolidation of power compared to the earlier days when municipality-owned companies dominated the sector. While this was an aim of the reform, intended to bring about greater efficiency, enhanced expertise and increased competitiveness, it has later been criticized. It has been pointed out, in particular, that the practical consequence of liberalization has been that the local accountability of the electricity sector has been lost, both organizationally and politically.\footnote{See \cite{agnell11}. 

As I have already mentioned, the market-orientation of the electricity sector has reduced the level of political control and accountability. Today, a management model based on economic rationality and expert rule has become dominant. According to Brekke and Sataøen, this serves to set the reform that took place in Norway apart from similar energy reforms in Sweden and the UK.\footnote{See \cite{brekke12}.} Moreover, Brekke and Sataøen argue that this may be part of the underlying reason behind some recent controversies, particularly with regards to the development of the national grid. 

The most serious case so far is that of {\it Sima - Samnanger}, a new distribution line that will cut through the area known as {\it Hardanger}, a scenic part of south-western Norway. The local population vigorously protested the plans.\footnote{See \cite[22-23]{brekke12}.} It would destroy a valuable part of Norwegian nature, they argued, without providing the people living there with anything in return.\footcite[26-27]{brekke12} %Moreover, opponents of the line noted the lack of open political debate preceding the decision.\footnote{...} 
%They successfully brought the issue onto the national stage, gaining wide support in the Norwegian public. The impression many had was that the decision to build the distribution line had been made behind closed doors, on dubious factual premises that had not been subjected to sufficient scrutiny and debate. In short, the case was taken by many to illustrate a shortcoming of governance.
%Indeed, as pointed out by Brekke and Sataøen, the Norwegian system is characterised by expert rule and a very limited degree of local and political involvement in the decision-making processes regarding grid management.\footnote{This is contrasted with the UK and Swedish systems respectively, see \cite[26]{brekke12}.}

The controversy surrounding the {\it Sima - Samnanger} line also suggests that the current management of the national grid may lead to projects that fail to produce local benefits even when such benefits would result from reasonable alternatives.\footcite[27]{brekke12} As a consequence of this, local communities will easily come to feel that they have to pay the price without getting a share of the benefit.

As I have already mentioned, the reform of the early 1990s saw the emergence of a new kind of market player, namely the small-scale developer cooperating with local owners. Since the mid- to late 1990s, the small-scale sector has grown significantly. It has been estimated that about one third of the remaining potential for hydropower in Norway, measured in annual energy output, will come from small-scale projects.\footnote{See \cite[231]{nou129}.}

Many established energy companies have entered into the small-scale market, but they are facing serious competition from new actors, several of which are completely owner-controlled. This development has been a counterweight to the increasingly centralised ownership pattern of the grid and the existing large-scale hydropower plants. In many ways, owner-led and owner-cooperating companies have replaced the municipality companies as the local anchor of the hydropower sector. 

In a recent report, the potential for profitable small-scale hydropower projects was estimated to be around 20 TWh/year.\footnote{See \cite{aanesland09}. For comparison, suggesting the scale of this potential, I mention that the total consumption of electricity in Norway in 2011 amounted to 114 TWh, see http://www.ssb.no/en/energi-og-industri/statistikker/elektrisitetaar.} On this basis, the authors of the report estimate that the total present-day value of the waterfalls suitable for small-scale hydropower is about 35 billion Norwegian kroner, i.e., about 3.5 billion pounds.\footnote{See \cite[1]{aanesland09}.} This calculation is based on a model where the waterfalls are exploited in cooperation with a commercial company, {\it Småkraft AS}. It might be an underestimate of what small scale hydro-power could represent for local communities if they remain in charge of development themselves.

Clearly, small-scale hydropower has become socially and political significant in Norway. In the report mentioned above, it is estimated that the value of waterfalls amount to just under 50 \% of the equity in Norwegian agriculture.\footcite[1]{aanesland09} Moreover, hydropower is increasingly seen as a possibility for declining regions to counter depopulation and poverty. In addition, it awards these communities a chance to regain some autonomy and influence with respect to how local natural resources should be managed. In some regions, small-scale hydropower is the only growth industry, and takes on great political and social importance, not just for the owners of waterfalls, but also for the community as a whole.

For an example of a community where small-scale hydropower has played such a role, I point to Gloppen, a municipality in the county of Sogn og Fjordane, in the western part of Norway. 19 schemes have already having been successfully carried out, all except one by local owners, amounting to a total production of over 250 GWh/year. This prompted the mayor to comment that ``small scale hydro-power is in our blood''.\footnote{See \cite{starheim12}.} When interviewed, he also directed attention at the fact that hydropower had many positive ripple effects, since it significantly increased local investment in other industries, particularly agriculture, which had been severely on the decline.

To achieve such effects, it is important to organise development in an appropriate manner. Moreover, to explain how waterfalls came to be as valuable as they are today, it is crucial to direct attention to the way in which waterfall owners asserted themselves on the market. In the following, I do this by giving an in-depth presentation of an early model for local involvement in hydropower development, published at a seminar in 1996.\footnote{See \cite{dyrkolbotn96}.} This model contains an early expression of several organisational ideas that would prove influential to the development of the small-scale hydropower sector.

However, certain other aspects of the model have not been widely adopted in practice. These are aspects  that pertain to the balance of power between owners and developers, as well as the relationship that should be established with larger communities of non-owners, including environmental groups and other water users. Hence, considering the model in some depth, and assessing its impact, will allow me to shed light on the social functions of waterfall ownership, and the extent to which this dimension plays a role on the market today.

%In the following I will discuss this part of the sector in more depth, by tracking the development of the current practices that characterize their operations on the market. 

%In this section, I will present the typical steps involved in obtaining a license to develop hydropower. As I have already discussed, different rules apply to different kinds of projects. Here I will focus on the common elements, particularly those that relate to the role of local owners and communities. In this respect, the various procedures do not differ significantly, although the more extensive application process required for large schemes will obviously tend to result in greater attention directed at the plans, something that  might in turn result in greater local involvement in the decision-making process.\footnote{The most important procedural distinction is made between those applications that require an impact assessment (IA) and those that do not. The current rule is that projects that will produce more than 40 GWh/year require an impact assessment, while projects that will produce more than 30 GWh/year might require an impact assessment, as determined by the NVE. See {\it Directive Regarding Impact Assessment} of 26 June 2009, issued by the Ministry of the Environment pursuant to sections 4-2 and 14-6 of the \cite{pb08}.}

%Before the introduction of a centralized system of management of water resources, local farmers made extensive use of the power inherent in water. According to Terje Tvedt, there were 20 -- 30 000 watermills in Norway by the 1830s.\footnote{References} These were not used to produce electricity, but as grist mills, to create flour. This pattern of use rendered waterfalls of limited interest to outside investors or the state, so no significant pressures were placed on the local communities and their exercise of self-governance. On the other hand, Tvedt also stresses the importance of water, including its political implications, and how they gave local communities a better basis on which to claim a right to self-governance also in other matters. Indeed, the control over water, emerging as a side-effect of the control over land, played an important role in empowering Norwegian farmers and their communities in the 19th century. 
%
%Towards the end of the 19th century, local self-governance of water came under increasing pressure from outside investors. This happened in response to increased interest in hydropower as a potential source of energy for industrial exploits. Indeed, more and more waterfalls were purchased as mere objects of speculation, often by foreigners. As a result, the Norwegian government felt compelled to introduce regulation to protect national interests. This led to the passing of the predecessors of the \cite{ica17} and \cite{wra17}, referred to in Norway as the ``panic acts'' of 1909. They set up the basic license requirement for purchase of waterfalls and development of large-scale hydropower involving regulation, while also creating a space for the state as a marker player, by introducing the rule of reversion. 
%
%Still, however, development of hydropower was mostly undertaken by private companies, either large industrial companies like Norsk Hydro AS, or else community-owned companies that wanted to supply electricity locally. It was not until after WW2 that the state assumed the role as the leading hydropower developer in Norway. This was also when the national electricity grid was established and put under direct state control. Previously, the grid had been operated by a mix of state and private actors, who had organized themselves in a joint umbrella organization. Now, however, hydropower development for electricity production was linked with management of the grid, by the establishment of municipal and state-controlled electricity providers, organized as public bodies rather than commercial companies. 
%
%This area saw the extensive use of expropriation to facilitate hydropower. In1940, an act was passed which provided the necessary authority to compulsorily acquire waterfalls for hydropower. This act explicitly stipulated that expropriation should only take place in favor of projects that would serve the electricity supply in the local area. Hence, at this time, the use of expropriation to further the development of hydropower was specifically linked to the idea that the electricity supply should be organized as a non-commercial public service.
%
%During this time, many local hydropower plants that had previously supplied electricity locally were shut down. In particular, they were not allowed to connect to the national grid. Moreover, the grid authorities would often explicitly require these plants to shut down as a precondition to allow the local community to connect to the national grid. The waterfall owners were left marginalized during this time, as they had no real opportunity to develop hydropower themselves, or sell their rights to anyone else than the local monopolist. 
%
%However, as I will discuss in more detail in Chapter \ref{chap:5}, a system was developed -- not through legislation, but by the appraisal courts -- to ensure that the owners would receive at least some compensation for their waterfalls. This was despite the fact that under the prevailing regulatory regime, waterfalls were practically worthless to local owners. Hence, the compensation measures adopted reflected the tradition for local control over waterfalls. If such measures had not been introduced, in particular, local owners would hardly be entitled to any compensation at all under ordinary Norwegian expropriation law.
%
%Following liberalization of the energy sector, the basic premise for this way of organizing hydropower development was lost. In particular, hydropower development was now to be regarded as a commercial enterprise, within a market-based system. This removed the conceptual legitimacy of a system that marginalized local owners. Moreover, the most important practical impediment to owner-led development was also removed, as non-discriminatory access to the grid was provided for in statute. 
%
%As a result, there has been a surge of interest in the exploitation of waterfalls in owner-led hydropower schemes. In addition, the established energy companies have, to some extent, embraced this new situation by competing also in attempting to strike deals with the local owners. In this way, they recognize the right of self-governance and owner-management of hydropower, thereby helping to further undermine the rationale behind using expropriation. 
%
%But not all companies have responded in this way. Many of the largest and most influential companies ahve refused to alter their practices, and expect that they will still be able to enjoy the use of expropriation. These actors, which are often partly state-owned, refuse to recognize the right of waterfall owners to assume a decisive role in the mangement of their resource. Moreover, the are unwilling to enter the market for waterfalls in competition with actors that wish to collaborate with local owners. This has created considerable tension in recent years. 

%As we have mentioned, the typical owners of Norwegian waterfalls are communities of farmers and smallholders. Historically, the right to land-based resources, especially in the mountainous areas of the west and the north, where most valuable waterfalls are located, was held by local people, the same people who made use of it on a day to day basis. The main reason for this, which by European standards stands out as quite unusual, was that Norway never really had a separate class of landed nobility. Consequently, the Norwegian farmer occupied a position of relative autonomy and freedom, even to the point of exercising significant political influence, especially in the early days of Norwegian democracy.\footnote{During the 19th century the two dominant group in Norwegian politics were the farmers and the civil servants, and the former group exercised great influence in the Norwegian parliament, with the 1833 election leading to what became known as the farmers parliament. The "classic" academic treatment of farmers' influence over 19th century Norwegian politics is \cite{Koht} (in Norwegian). More on the author and a summary of his views can be found here, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halvdan\_Koht.} Following industrialization, however, their role became much more marginal, and farming has steadily become more and more unprofitable, with many farming communities having already disappeared, and many others threatened by depopulation. In light of this, the possibility of undertaking small scale hydro-power is often seen as being important to the survival of rural communities themselves, not just as a means for individual members of such communities to make a profit.

\section{{\it Nordhordlandsmodellen}}

In five brief points, the {\it Nordhordlandsmodellen} sets out a framework for cooperation between waterfall owners, professional energy companies, local communities, and greater society.\footnote{See \cite{dyrkolbotn96}. The model was presented at a seminar in 1996, as the result of a collaboration between Otto Dyrkolbotn, a farmer and a lawyer, and Arne Steen, the director of {\it Nordhordland Kraftlag}, a municipality-owned energy company.} %The first three of these points would later provide the blueprint for many commercial actors hoping to cooperate with local owner. The last two points, which seek to address environmental concerns and the interests of the community more broadly, have largely been ignored.
The first point makes clear that the aim of cooperation should be to ensure local ownership and control, with outside interests never holding more than 50 \% of the shares in the development company. If such a company is organised as a limited liability firm, then the plan stipulates that local residents -- not necessarily owners -- are to be given a right of preemption in the event that shares come up for sale. The possibility of organising the development company as a local cooperative is also mentioned.

The second point of the model sets out the principle for valuing the waterfalls prior to development. It stipulates that the appraisement should reflect their real value, and goes on to propose that valuation should usually take place on the basis of lease capitalisation. That is, one assumes first that the owner of the waterfall is entitled to rent based on the level of annual production in the planned hydropower project. Then, for the purpose of appraisement, the expected rent is capitalised to find the present value of the waterfall, relative to this project.\footnote{This approach stands in stark contrast to the earlier valuation method used in the energy sector, which relied on a purely theoretical assessment based on the aforementioned notion of a natural horsepower. See \cite{dyrkolbotn15,hellandsfoss97}.}

After such a value has been calculated, the model stipulates that owners are to be given a choice of either leasing out their waterfalls to receive rent, or to use the capitalised value of (part of) this rent as equity to acquire shares in the development company. The third point in the model then offers a clarification, by stating that the development company should not in any event acquire ownership of the waterfalls, but only a time-limited right of use. After 25-35 years, this usufruct should fall away and full dominion over the waterfalls should revert back to the landowners, free of charge. This is the proposed rule also in cases when the landowners themselves control the majority of the shares in the development company. The plan demonstrates the commercial viability of this mode of development, by pointing to a concrete municipality-owned company that has stated its willingness to cooperate with owners on such terms, to help with financing and share the risk.\footnote{The company in question is Nordhordland Kraftlag, where one of the authors of the model, Arne Steen, was a director.}

The fourth and fifth points in the model go on to describe the intended role of company in society, by making clear that hydropower development should not take place in isolation from other interests and potential uses of the river. Rather, potential developers should expect to take on formal obligations towards other user groups. Moreover, obligations should not only be negatively defined, as duties to minimise or avoid harms. Positive obligations should also be introduced, such as duties to improve other qualities of the river system, and to engage in active cooperation with other users.

The model explicitly states that environmental concerns should be given due regard. As an illustration of a positive obligation arising from this, the model goes on to state that less invasive projects may have to be considered, even if this is not prescribed by the authorities. In some cases, environmental concerns can suggest solutions that are not economically optimal. In addition, fishing and tourism are mentioned as concrete examples of other water uses that the hydropower company should actively seek to promote.

The overall aim, it is made clear, is to ensure sustainable management of the river system as a whole. Interestingly, the model predicts that local ownership will make this easier, and will make a contribution to sustainability that exceeds what can be achieved through governmental regulation alone. This claim is then illustrated by a concrete example of a case in which the local owners decided to pursue a scheme that was less invasive than the project endorsed by the water authorities.\footnote{Today, this project has become Svartdalen Kraftverk, finalised in 2006. It produces 30 GWh annually, enough electricity for about 1500 households, see \url{http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svartdalen_kraftverk}.}

The model goes on to emphasise the need for integrated processes of resource planning and decision-making, to ensure that hydropower development is not approached as an isolated environmental concern, but looked at in a broader social and political context. To achieve this, it is argued, local communities need to play an important role in the management of water resources. Another concrete example follows, regarding the master plan for Romarheimsvassdraget, a river system in the municipality of Lindås. 

This river system was originally intended for large-scale development undertaken by BKK AS, with no involvement of local owners.\footnote{This is one of the 15 biggest hydropower companies in Norway, which would later also purchase Nordhordland Kraftlag.} The project would involve a total of three river systems, such that the water from Romarheimselva and another river would be diverted to a neighbouring municipality for hydropower development there. After local owners got involved in the planning, they argued against these plans. Moreover, they were successful, as the NVE agreed to endorse an alternative consisting of 7 distinct run-of-river projects undertaken in cooperation with local owners.\footnote{See {\it Vassragsrapport nr. 25}, Direktoratet for Naturforvaltning, 1999.}

It is important to note that when Nordhordlandsmodellen was formulated, owner-led development of hydropower was still a recent phenomenon, driven forward by individual owners and smaller groups that saw the potential and had enough know-how to get organised. Later, however, commercial companies emerged that specialised in cooperating with local owners.\footnote{For a good survey of later developments, I point to \cite{larsen06,larsen08,larsen12}.} Today, many such companies operate, making it relatively easy to initiate a process of owner-led development. Moreover, owners that are not themselves aware of the potential in their waterfalls are often approached by interested commercial actors, who will tend to compete for the chance of striking a deal. Most of these companies rely on cooperation on terms that reflect many of the key ideas expressed in the first three points of Nordhordlandsmodellen.

However, several adjustments have become standard, and they systematically benefit the external partner: the requirement that locals should at all times control a majority of the shares is dropped, the period of usufruct is typically longer than 35 years, the reversion to the landowners after this time is made conditional on payment for machines and installations, and no preemption rights are granted to local residents. Importantly, however, the core idea that waterfalls are to be valued based on a capitalisation of future rent is accepted. This means, in turn, that local owners rarely need to raise any additional capital to acquire shares in the development company. Moreover, the rent itself can become a significant source of income. 

There are two main approaches to calculating this rent. The first approach, introduced already in Nordhordlandsmodellen, specifies the rent as a percentage of the gross income from sale of electricity, typically 10-30 \%. In this way, passive owners need not take on any risk related to the performance of the hydropower company. The second approach has been developed by the company Småkraft AS, which is now the leading market actor specialising in cooperation with local owners.\footnote{It is owned by several large-scale actors on the energy market, see \url{www.smaakraft.no}.} According to their model, the waterfall owners are paid a share of the annual {\it surplus} from hydropower generation.

This share is usually higher than the rent payable based on the net income; often, the owners are entitled to $50 \%$ of the profit.\footnote{See \cite{aanesland09}.} Hence, if the project is a success, the owners of the waterfall can expect to be better compensated. However, they do accept some risks as though they were shareholders, and they do so even though they might not have much of a say in how the company is run.\footnote{To limit the risk for owners, Småkraft operates a system of ``guaranteed'' rent, but this rent is usually quite a lot less than what the owners could expect from an agreement bade solely on rent based on net income.}

To illustrate the financial scale of the kinds of rent agreements that have now become standard, let us consider a typical small-scale hydropower plant that produces 10 GWh annually. With an electricity price of 0.3 kr/KWh, this gives the hydropower plant an annual gross income of 3 million kr. If the rent payable is 20 \%, the waterfall owners will receive kr 600 000 annually, some £ 60 000. By contrast, if the rights were expropriated, the traditional method of valuation, a theoretical calculation based on the natural horsepower of the development project, would rarely if ever result in more than kr 600 000 as a {\it one-time payment} for a waterfall that yields 10 GWh/year.\footnote{Sometimes, the difference in valuation would be even greater, since the natural horsepower of a development project is highly sensitive to the level of regulation of the waterfall, much more so than the value of the development. For an illustration of how this affected compensation according to the natural horsepower method, one may consider the case \cite{hellandsfoss97}, which went to the Supreme Court. Here the owners were paid just over kr 1 million for a waterfall that would yield 100 GWh/year.}

Hence, the financial consequences of the ideas expressed in {\it Norhordlandsmodellen} have been dramatic. On the other hand, it seems that the latter two points of the model, addressing the importance of responsible and inclusive management of river systems, have not had the same degree of influence on the market. In the next section, I address this in more depth and comment on some recent developments that threaten to undermine the status of small-scale development as a sustainable alternative to large-scale exploitation. I argue, in particular, that the future of hydropower will likely leave local owners and their communities marginalised, unless a social function approach to small-scale development is adopted.

\section{The Future of Hydropower}\label{sec:future}

In recent years, there has been a growing tension between the small-scale hydropower sector and environmental groups. There is talk of a brewing ``hydropower battle'', as environmentalists grow increasingly critical of what they regard as predatory practices.\footnote{See \cite{haltbrekken12}.}
Reports on small-scale producers who violate regulations help fuel the negative impression of the industry.\footnote{In 2010, the NVE conducted randomised inspections and announced that 4 out of 5 mini and micro plants operated in violation of regulations pertaining to the amount of water they may use at any given time. See \url{http://www.tu.no/kraft/2010/12/13/sma-kraftverk-driver-ulovlig} (accessed on 31 January 2015). In the largest newspaper in Norway, this was reported under the heading that four out of five small-scale plants break the law, see \url{http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/stroemprisene/fire-av-fem-smaakraftverk-driver-ulovlig/a/10020264/} (accessed on 31 January 2015). This is misleading, since mini and micro plants are distinct from small-scale plants proper, in that they do not require a sector-specific development license. Because of this, it also seems plausible that the reported violations might in large part be due to lack of knowledge and professionalism. I remark that questions later emerged regarding the accuracy of the report itself. Apparently, one of the plants that was reported to have violated regulations did not even exist, see \url{http://www.energibransjen.no/default.asp?menu=2&id=1722} (accessed on 31 January 2015).} At the same time, the price of electricity has been much lower in recent years than what had previously been forecast, causing severe financial difficulty for many small-scale developers.\footnote{See \url{http://www.bondebladet.no/midten/smakraft-kong-midas-i-revers/}.} This has also revealed that some of the actors on the market have engaged in speculative practices, by aggressively entering into agreements with local owners, without carrying out much actual hydropower development.\footnote{See \url{http://www.dn.no/nyheter/2014/03/20/Energi/solgte-for-kraftflopp}.}

On the regulatory side, the water authorities have announced that they will adopt stricter procedures to assess licenses for small-scale hydropower.\footnote{See \url{http://www.tu.no/kraft/2012/01/18/nve-varsler-flere-smakraft-avslag} (accessed 31 January 2015).} In addition, different planning routines have been adopted to ensure that small-scale schemes are no longer considered individually, but in so-called ``packages'', collecting together applications from the same area. As a consequence of these changes, the number of rejected applications have increased dramatically in recent years.\footnote{In 2013, the number of rejections tripled compared to previous years, while the number of accepted applications remained stable. See \url{http://www.bondebladet.no/nyhet/rekordmange-smakraft-avslag/} (accessed 31 January 2015).}

Many powerful market actors, who still favour a traditional mode of exploitation, have seized the opportunity to revive the idea of large-scale exploitation.\footnote{See, e.g., \url{http://www.nord24.no/nyheter/article7531155.ece}.} This, they argue, is preferable also from an environmental point of view. It might be more damaging to the affected area, the argument goes, but at the same time, a few large-scale projects mean that many other areas can be left undisturbed with no loss of total energy output. This argument has proven successful in many quarters, particularly among state agencies, such as the NVE and the Norwegian Environmental Agency.\footnote{See \url{http://www.tu.no/kraft/2011/10/14/vil-ha-storre-vannkraftverk} (accessed 31 January 2015).} It has also been claimed that this perspective is backed up by research done on environmental effects of small-scale and large-scale projects.\footnote{See generally \cite{bakken12,bakken14}.} However, I believe this claim to be largely incorrect.

In particular, the research in question concludes that large-scale projects generally requires {\it much more} land per energy unit produced.\footcite[96]{bakken14}. At the same time, it is shown that small-scale plants indirectly affect a greater total area, per energy unit produced.\footcite[96-99]{bakken14}. This is not surprising, as small-scale development is a decentralised approach to hydropower, which requires plants at many different sites to match the energy produced by a single larger plant. However, the research on indirect effects has little or nothing to say about how exactly small-scale plants impact on the environment, compared to large-scale projects. In particular, the parameters used to compare the two are defined in terms of generic buffer zones, that do not take into account differences in the severity of different kinds of environmental intrusions.\footcite[95]{bakken14}.

The only buffer that is determined from information about actual effects is the scenic buffer, the area from which some installation can be seen. But even for this parameter, no distinction is made based on the actual visual impression; a large dam that dries up a river and makes it possible to regulate the water in a lake by several meters counts the same as a small cabin with a generator inside.\footnote{See \cite[95]{bakken14}.} For the other parameters, the data available on indirect effects is even more dubious, since the buffers are set rather arbitrarily, according to general rules of thumb.\footnote{See \cite[95]{bakken14}.} For instance, a conflict with a threatened species is assumed to arise whenever a technical installation occurs within a certain distance from its natural habitat.\footnote{See \cite[95]{bakken14}.} Importantly, nothing is said about the severity of conflict, and no distinction is made between a minor installation and a massive disturbance.

Even so, the idea that large-scale development is better for the environment is fast gaining ground among the administrative decision-makers in Norway. This change of opinion and, increasingly, of practice, has taken place despite a consistent political narrative that emphasises how large-scale projects are a thing of the past while small-scale hydropower represents the future. In his New Year's speech 01 January 2001, the Prime Minister declared that the age of large-scale development was over.\footnote{See, e.g., \cite[34]{haltbrekken12}.}. The same phrase was then repeated in the policy platforms of two successive governments, in 2005 and 2009 respectively.\footnote{See the ``Soria Moria'' declaration from 2005, p 57, and ``Soria Moria II'', from 2009, p 52 (available at \url{www.regjeringen.no}).} Despite this, the legal position of owners and local communities has weakened in recent years. The best example of this is the case of {\it Otra}, concerning a large-scale development project in the southern part of Norway.\footnote{See \url{http://www.otrakraft.no/}.} 

The developer of this project was granted permission to expropriate waterfalls, resulting in a legal conflict that went to the Supreme Court twice, as the waterfall owners argued that they should be compensated for the loss of a small-scale development potential.\footnote{See \cite{otra10,otra13}.} First, the owners were successful in this claim, but the Supreme Court sent the case back to the appraisal court of appeal on a technicality.\footnote{See \cite{otra10}.} The second time the case came before this court, it was decided that compensation for the lost small-scale potential should not be awarded, since a small-scale scheme could not expect to obtain a development license.\footnote{See \cite{otra13}.} This was so, the court held, {\it because} the large-scale development -- which presupposed expropriation -- represented a superior form of exploitation.\footnote{See \cite{otra13}. I note that the court's reasoning on this point is at odds with what is known as the ``no-scheme'' principle in the UK, see e.g., \cite{lawcom01}. This principle states, roughly, that compensation following expropriation should not reflect changes in value that are due to the expropriation scheme. A no-scheme principle is typically observed in Norway as well, but it is a general feature of Norwegian expropriation law that this principle is applied rather narrowly in case the expropriation scheme follows from public planning (in which case applying a no-scheme rule tends to result in higher compensation). See, e.g., \cite{stordrange07}.} The consequence of this was that the waterfalls were compensated based on the natural horsepower method. Only a few years earlier, leading hydropower lawyers had predicted that this method was a thing of the past.\footnote{See \cite{larsen12}.} After the decision in {\it Otra II}, there is reason to believe that the future will hold the opposite scenario in store; compensation for small-scale potentials will be a thing of the past, at least in all cases when expropriation takes place to benefit large-scale development.

The end of large-scale exploitation has simply not become a reality, despite being official government policy for almost 15 years. Interestingly, the leading national politicians are now changing their position as well. The timing of this shift is interesting in its own right, as it suggests that the politicians follow the lead of the expert planners and the commercial interests, rather than the other way around. Indeed, one of the first clear renunciations of the small-scale narrative came during the opening of the {\it Otra} plant, in 2014. The Minister himself presided over the festivities, and used the occasion to explicitly reject the previous political line, by publicly declaring that he was in favour of more large-scale development.\footnote{See \url{http://www.tu.no/kraft/2014/10/28/energiministeren-etterlyser-mer-regulerbar-vannkraft}.}

This political shift is likely to result in a further weakening of property rights and the rights of local communities. For example, it provides indirect political legitimacy to the NVE, who now pursue an explicit policy of prioritising applications for large-scale projects when these come into conflict with small-scale schemes in the same rivers.\footnote{See letter from the NVE of 21 March 2012 regarding new routines for the assessment of hydropower applications.} In effect, the NVE will refuse to consider applications from owners as long as there are applications pending that might result in the expropriation of their property.
%\footnote{The NVE have tended to apply such a priority rule for many years, but the legality of such an approach has been somewhat unclear (it depends on whether or not giving priority to takers is necessary to facilitate public planning, see \cite[21]{wra00}). However, after the decision in \cite{jorpeland11}, where a waterfall taking was unsuccessfully challenged on procedural grounds, the NVE seems less hesitant in general to adopt a ``strict'' line when dealing with recalcitrant owners.}

All in all, it seems that small-scale hydropower is loosing both its force and its credibility as a sustainable alternative for development. I think the underlying causes of this deserve attention in future work. To what extent is the political shift attributable to lobbying from powerful market actors? Is the shift in attention motivated by the fact that waterfalls can be acquired cheaply by force if they are needed for large-scale development? A serious examination of these and related questions would require further empirical study, and must be left for future work.

Here I would instead like to emphasise how recent misfortunes for the small-scale sector suggest the importance of adopting a broader, non-commercial, perspective on privately held rights to waterfalls. In fact, I think the small-scale sector itself needs to be challenged with its seeming failure to comprehensively address social and environmental concerns. It seems plausible to hypothesise that part of the reason why the small-scale sector has been so easily undermined has to do with the fact that the industry itself has failed to broadly mobilise property owners and local communities in decision-making processes.

In fact, the small-scale industry has on occasion actively sought to undermine property rights, possibly in an effort to mimic the successes of their large-scale competitors. The industry has argued, in particular, that expropriation should be made more easily available as a tool for small-scale developers and owners who wish to take property from reluctant neighbours.\footnote{See \cite{brekken07,brekken08}. The articles are written by a leading Norwegian energy lawyer, apparently in his capacity as legal representative of ``Småkraftforeningen'', an interest organisation for small-scale hydropower (the articles are published in the newsletter of this organisation).} The argument rests on a peculiar form of anti-discrimination reasoning; as long as large-scale developers are allowed to take property by force, small-scale developers should be allowed to do the same. In a world where takings are endemic, this might make some sense. However, it is hardly an attitude that helps the small-scale industry preserve its image as the more sustainable hydropower option.

%At the same time, one should not disregard the fact that many power companies appae who lobby may feel threatened by the surge of interest in small-scale hydropower. As I will discuss in the next chapter, recent case law on expropriation shows how the largest actors are working very hard to regain control over the market. Recently, they have been successful in court, and this too might be a reason behind the shift in political climate. Nevertheless, it strikes me as appropriate to direct a critical eye towards the small-scale industry itself. It seems, in particular, that the objective of profit-maximising has taken center stage to an extent that might harm the sector. %According to Norhordlandsmodellen, the environmentalists were natural partners of the small-scale hydropower movement. But now, they are fast becoming its sworn enemies.\footnote{See \cite{haltebrekken12}.} I think this aspect, in particular, is dangerous to the future of the industry, as it previously benefited greatly precisely because of its image as a more environmentally friendly alternative.

My cautious and critical remarks should not detract from the fact that the growth in small-scale hydropower has led to dramatically increased benefit sharing with many local owners of waterfalls. However, I believe recent developments point to the importance of considering the broader societal context of new commercial practices. This echoes the more theoretical discussion in Chapter \ref{chap:1}. There I argued that an entitlements-based perspective on property rights fails to do justice to the issue of economic development takings. In relation to hydropower development, this insight is strongly implicit in Nordhordlandsmodellen. However, in the current debating climate it seems to be at risk of disappearing from view.

To counter this, I believe the social function view of property must be developed further in the context of Norwegian hydropower. The aim should be to arrive at models of participation that further entrench the ideas implicit in Nordhordlandsmodellen, particularly the latter two points. I return to this issue in Chapter \ref{chap:6}, where I argue that the system of Land Consolidation Courts can be used to achieve this. First, I will zoom in on the issue of expropriation, where the mechanisms identified in this section often lead to concrete legal disputes. This, in turn, gives rise to principles and rules that will play an important role in shaping the future framework for water management in Norway. Moreover, it brings into focus important issues surrounding the status of economic development takings under Norwegian law.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc3}

In this Chapter, I introduced my case study and provided background information that places it in a broader context with respect to Norwegian law. I presented the legal and regulatory framework surrounding hydropower development, while also tracing its history back to pre-industrial times. I noted that local rights to hydropower has a long tradition in Norway. However, I also observed that after the advent of the industrial age, and particularly following the Second World War, the state took the view that hydropower was a public good that should be exploited in the public interest.

The tension that followed now permeates the law on hydropower, particularly following the liberalising reform of the early 1990s. This reform reorganised hydropower development as a commercial pursuit -- the public interest would not longer be the guiding force behind the activities of Norway's leading hydropower companies. At the same time, local owners were empowered by the reform, as they were now able to engage in commercial hydropower development themselves. This was made possible by the fact that a market for electricity was set up, founded on the idea that all actors should have access to the grid on non-discriminatory terms. 

I discussed the resulting system in some depth, addressing also the question of whether or not the market functions as intended. I noted that the energy reform led to a concentration of power in the energy sector, where commercial companies partly owned by the state now wield more power than ever before. This, I argued, threatens to undermine the intentions behind the reform. I also looked at the extent to which the regulatory framework is able to accommodate new actors and true competition on non-discriminatory terms. I focused particularly on the status of locally led projects as well as the companies that specialise in cooperating with owners. I also discussed controversies that have resulted, particularly relating to the perceived discrimination of smaller actors on the market.

Then I went on to present a prototype for the model by which the smaller actors now tend to organise themselves. I observed that they too often appear to have adopted a strongly commercial outlook on the meaning of local hydropower development. I discussed how this departs from earlier ideas, which were based on seeing local development as an expression of local democracy and local management of resources. This earlier vision actively sought to ensure sustainability and incorporate other interests in the decision-making, a perspective that now seems to have largely disappeared from view.

I concluded by arguing that this is a likely reason why small-scale development now seems to be falling out of favour with the political elite, and, increasingly, also with the public. Today, critical voices claim that large-scale development is better, not only because it is more commercially optimal, but also because they claim it results in a less negative total effect on the natural environment. Moreover, issues relating to ownership, control, benefit sharing and local participation, appear only at the fringes, both of the current debate and the current regulatory framework. 

This state of affairs, I think, foreshadows many of the issues that will be brought into focus in the next chapter. There, I will look specifically at expropriation of waterfalls, by tracking the position of owners under the current regime. I will argue that the law as it stands is based on a perspective that blocks out both the significant commercial interests of the taker, as well as the significant social functions and obligations of the original owners. The issue of expropriation, in particular, will invariably raise questions that seem difficult to address without adopting a broader view, which also takes into account the owners' communities and their role within it.
