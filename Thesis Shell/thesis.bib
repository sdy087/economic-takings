title = {Partnering with Strasbourg: Constitutionalisation of the European Court of Human Rights, the Accession of Central and East European States to the Council of Europe, and the Idea of Pilot Judgments},
volume = {9}, 
number = {3}, 
pages = {397-453}, 
year = {2009}, 
doi = {10.1093/hrlr/ngp011}, 
abstract ={The accession of Central and East European States into the European Convention of Human Rights system was both a threat and a promise to the system. The threat resulted not only from the substantial increase of the number of Contracting States and that of the case-load, but also from the demise of a consensus which was, originally, presupposed by the system of protection of human rights in Western Europe: original members of the Council of Europe were ‘like-minded’ and the Convention system did not represent a challenge to their internal patterns of human rights protection. This article, however, focuses on a promise: a possibility for the European Court of Human Rights to abandon once and for all the fiction that it is merely a sort of super-appellate court which scrutinises individual decisions rather than laws in Contracting States. This shift towards a quasi-constitutional role, going beyond the simple identification of wrong individual decisions so as to point to systemic legal defects, was triggered by systemic problems within the new Contracting States, while also facilitated by collaboration between the European Court of Human Rights and national constitutional courts. The emergence of so-called ‘pilot judgments’ is the best and most recent illustration of this trend. The way in which a national court may form a de facto alliance with the European Court effectively ‘pierces the veil of the State’, and positions the European Court as a quasi-constitutional judicial body at a pan-European level.},

year = {2012},
abstract ={In spite of the implementation of Protocol No 14 to the European Convention on Human Rights on 1 June 2010, the European Court of Human Rights continues to face a case overload crisis with no definitive solution in sight. In this article we reconsider the role ‘constitutionalisation’ might play in providing a more secure future. Having distinguished the three dominant analytical frameworks—‘individual justice’, ‘constitutional justice’ and ‘pluralism’—in the ‘official’ and ‘academic/judicial’ streams of the debate, we conclude that a fourth, ‘constitutional pluralism’, now offers a particularly attractive alternative.},

title = {Redesigning the European Court of Human Rights: Embeddedness as a Deep Structural Principle of the European Human Rights Regime},
volume = {19}, 
number = {1}, 
pages = {125-159}, 
year = {2008},
abstract ={The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) is the crown jewel of the world's most advanced international system for protecting civil and political liberties. In recent years, however, the ECtHR has become a victim of its own success. The Court now faces a docket crisis of massive proportions, the consequence of the growing number of states subject to its jurisdiction, its favourable public reputation, its expansive interpretations of individual liberties, a distrust of domestic judiciaries in some countries, and entrenched human rights problems in others. In response to this growing backlog of individual complaints, the Council of Europe has, over the last five years, considered numerous proposals to restructure the European human rights regime and redesign the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). This article argues that these proposals should be understood not as ministerial changes in supranational judicial procedure, nor as resolving a debate over whether the ECtHR should strive for individual or constitutional justice, but rather as raising more fundamental questions concerning the Court's future identity. In particular, the article argues for recognition of ‘embeddedness’ in national legal systems as a deep structural principle of the ECHR, a principle that functions as a necessary counterpoint to the subsidiary doctrine that has animated the Convention since its founding. Embeddedness does not substitute ECtHR rulings for the decisions of national parliaments or domestic courts. Rather, it requires the Council of Europe and the Court to bolster the mechanisms for governments to remedy human rights violations at home, obviating the need for individuals to seek supranational relief and restoring countries to a position in which the ECtHR's deference to national decision-makers is appropriate.},

pages = {317-340}, 
year = {2004}, 
abstract ={The paper outlines the 20th-century history of American zoning to explain how home-owners came to dominate its content and administration in most jurisdictions. Zoning's original purpose was to protect home-owners in residential areas from devaluation by industrial and apartment uses that had been made footloose by trucks and buses around 1910-20. Completion of the interstate highway system around 1970 made jobs and employees so mobile that suburbs adopted growth controls to stem the tide. If zoning is indeed a substitute for home-value insurance, it seems worthwhile to investigate the possibility of home-equity insurance to reduce the demand for exclusionary zoning.},

The legal scholars most interested in GC have worked in three areas: general property theory, environmental and natural resource law, and since the mid-1990s, intellectual property. In all those areas legal scholars have found GC and its many examples a strong source of support for the proposition that people can cooperate to overcome common pool resource issues, managing resources through informal norms rather than either individual property or coercive government. Legal academics have also been at least mildly critical of GC, however. A number have tried to balance the attractive features of GC's governance model - stability and sustainability - with more standard legal models favoring toward open markets, fluid change and egalitarianism.},

% p. 141 the popular understanding is that this is part of the eminent domain power of the State

% p. 143-144 An enquiry into eminent domain demonstrates that the power of eminent domain has been interpreted as being close to absolute power of the State over all land and interests in land within its territory. The effect [p. 144 ↓]of this has been that those without access to land and rights over land (including the landless, artisans, women as a composite group), those who may have use rights but no titles, communities holding common rights and others with inchoate interests, have had to bear the burden heaved on to them by eminent domain. Simultaneously, the plenitude of powers presumed to arise from the doctrine of eminent domain has allowed for an engorgement of state power over land.

%In relatively recent times, the policies of the State, ruggedly supported by legislation, have re-introduced the power of the ‘sovereign’ to use its discretion in facilitating the concentration of land in corporations.

% p. 137 In the early years of constitutionalism, it was about investing rights to land in the tiller and the tenant and as a move against absentee landlordism. It sought then to dispossess zamindars to prevent the concentration of land in a few hands, redistribute land to the landless and enforce a ceiling on how much land may be held by anyone. These were the purposes which gave constitutional sanction to the State exercise of the power to take over, redistribute and regulate ownership of land. How is it possible to justify dispossessing the tiller, mass eviction of landless labour, transfer of land rights from the farmer to corporations and facilitating the accumulation of large acreages in corporate hands based on the same Constitution?

% p. 40: In addition, under the power of eminent domain, the state attributes itself the power to take away for a public purpose any resource under its jurisdiction.32 In practice, eminent domain has often become an instrument of the state that is used to disempower people and redistribute rights and benefits. One of the uses of eminent domain is where the state takes over the property rights of people, for instance, their home to allow the construction of a big dam that provides benefits in the form of irrigation water, drinking water or hydropower to people in other parts of the country. These beneficiaries are often already better-off than the people affected by the use of the power of eminent domain.33

%p. 184 On the other hand, the link between individual land rights and control of water has been challenged in ongoing water sector reforms because it does not allow for the trading of water entitlements separately from the land itself. Indeed, the MWRRA has for the first time set up a system that allows trading of water entitlements without reference to land rights. As opposed to the Supreme Court proposal, this proposes to strengthen individual property rights over water.

	abstract = {The idea of a 'property-owning democracy' became central to John Rawls's re-evaluation of his theory of justice. This article traces the origins of Rawls's concept of `property-owning democracy' first to the writings of the economist James Meade and then to those of early twentieth-century British conservatives, focusing on the question of how the meaning of democracy was defined and re-defined throughout this history. I argue that Rawls inherited a discursive matrix from the British conservatives in which the notion of 'property-owning democracy' refers to the limits that should be set on democratic practices to make democracy compatible with the needs and interests of property-owners. In addition to tracing the genealogy of the idea of a 'property-owning democracy', the article points toward more recent attempts, partially inspired by Rawls's 'political turn', to re-examine the distribution of property-ownership from the perspective of what is required for viable democratic deliberations. The article ends with an addendum lamenting the fact that when George W. Bush's administration adopted the British ideas and policies associated with 'property-owning democracy' it chose to omit 'democracy' altogether and to describe its initiative as 'ownership society'}

However, the literature is sparse regarding how local leaders make decisions on this hot-button issue.

A survey of county managers in North Carolina was conducted to redress this apparent knowledge gap. Although the findings are primarily generalizable only to other Dillon's rule states, such data demonstrate that eminent domain applies more often for narrow (public use) purposes, such as water and sewer systems, than for {\textbackslash}grqqbroad” (public good) purposes, such as economic development. Current and future property considerations also influence eminent domain decisions.[A] law that takes property from A, and gives it to B: It is against all reason and justice, for a people to entrust a legislature with such powers; and, therefore, it cannot be presumed that they have done it.

	title = {Controlling the Grasping Hand: Economic Development Takings after Kelo},
	volume = {15},
	abstract = {The Supreme Court’s controversial decision in Kelo v. City of New London upheld the condemnation of private property for purposes of economic development. This Article argues that Kelo was wrongly decided and that courts should forbid economic development takings. Part I analyzes the flaws of economic development takings generally. Such condemnations allow politically powerful interest groups to capture the condemnation process for the purpose of enriching themselves at the expense of the poor and politically weak. This Part also shows that the need to eliminate holdout problems that could block desirable assembly projects cannot justify permitting economic development takings. In most cases, private developers can prevent holdouts by such noncoercive methods as assembling property in secret and adopting precommitment strategies that prevent holdouts from using their bargaining power. Part {II} considers the major alternatives to a categorical ban. While these proposals are not without merit, none can prevent eminent domain abuse as effectively as forbidding the economic development rationale altogether. In Part {III}, I consider the Kelo case itself. In advocating broad deference to local governments on public use issues, the Kelo majority unfortunately ignored the serious defects in the political processes that control economic development takings. The Court’s analysis of history and precedent also has significant weaknesses. Nonetheless, Kelo actually represents a modest improvement on the Court’s previous public use decisions, by holding out the possibility of at least slightly greater judicial scrutiny. Part {III} also provides a very preliminary assessment of the political backlash against Kelo, showing that much of the proposed anti-Kelo legislation provides little or no real protection for property owners. Part {IV} strikes an additional note of caution, showing that even a categorical ban on economic development takings is not a comprehensive solution to the underlying problem of eminent domain abuse. A ban on economic development takings can potentially be circumvented in several ways, most notably because such bans still permit condemnations to alleviate blight. Courts in many states have already defined blight so broadly that the definition could encompass virtually any property.},

     abstract = {This Article challenges a foundational assumption about eminent domain--namely, that owners are systematically undercompensated because they receive only fair market value for their property. In fact, scholars may have overstated the undercompensation problem because they have focused on the compensation required by the Constitution, rather than on the actual mechanics of the eminent domain process. The Article examines three ways that "Takers" (i.e., nonjudicial actors in the eminent domain process) minimize undercompensation. First, Takers may avoid taking high subjective value properties. (By way of illustration, Professor Garnett discusses evidence that Chicago's freeways were rerouted in the 1950s to avoid urban Catholic churches.) Second, in addition to paying compensation for the condemned property, Takers frequently must pay additional compensation to property owners in the form of "relocation assistance." Third, Takers and property owners may voluntarily settle on above-market compensation during precondemnation negotiations. (As an example, Professor Garnett includes an empirical case study of property acquired, under the threat of eminent domain, for a manufacturing facility in Indiana.) The Article concludes by reflecting upon current efforts to reform eminent domain legislatively. Prominent legal scholars recently have proposed compensation-based reforms as an alternative to constraints on the use of eminent domain. This Article rejects that suggestion, arguing that there are two problems, unique to takings raising "public use" questions, that more money cannot solve: first, high compensation levels may undermine political resistance to questionable projects; second, private takings may generate noninstrumental harms that will persist even as compensation increases.},

This oversight is particularly problematic in African studies. In sub-Saharan Africa the absence or weakness of secure property rights regimes in the countryside can have powerful consequences for multiparty dynamics. Land can become a patronage resource in ways that ignite destabilizing redistributive conflicts and threaten minority rights. By ignoring the design and character of underlying property regimes—or by assuming that the rules governing property are fixed, neutral, or essentially liberal in character—analysts have overlooked a fundamental source of illiberalism in many of Africa's multiparty systems. Côte d'Ivoire, where land politics have contributed to system-wide political breakdown, serves as a case in point.},

Such "anticommons" situations may justify government intervention through eminent domain, yet they often leave landowners undercompensated. This may skew the incentives for initiating land development projects and lead to considerable injustice. Although the taking component of eminent domain may need to remain an involuntary nonmarket transaction, we propose a market-based mechanism for the compensation component in the form of a Special-Purpose Development Corporation (SPDC). An SPDC would acquire unified ownership of the land and the development project, and would offer condemnees a choice between receiving pre-project "fair market value" compensation or pro rata shares in the SPDC. This would make it more likely that compensation is closely linked to the true economic value of the land and, consequently, that land assembly projects are both more just and genuinely social welfare maximizing.},

Is it possible to assemble land without harming the poor and powerless? Yes. This Article proposes the creation of Land Assembly Districts, or "LADs." This new property form solves the age-old tensions in eminent domain and shows, more generally, how careful redesign of property rights can enhance both welfare and fairness. The economic and moral intuition underlying LADs is simple: when the only justification for assembly is over-fragmentation of land, neighbors should be able to decide collectively whether their land will be assembled. Our legal theory solution is equally simple: use property law to retrofit communities with a condominium-like structure tailored to land assembly. Let's try giving those burdened by condemnation a way to share in its benefits and to veto projects they decide are not worth their while.},

abstract = "Property rights to land can be thought of as a web of interests, with many different parties having a right to use, regulate, or manage the resource, which may be based on a range of customary institutions or local norms as well as state law. These interests often play a critical role in livelihoods, social relations, and ecological functions. The formalization of property rights has historically led to a cutting of this web, creating more exclusive forms of rights over the resource. Drawing from case studies in Kenya the paper emphasizes the risk of excluding legitimate claimants in formalization processes that focus on individual titling. By collapsing all rights within individuals, such programs have negated the distinct multiple claims by women, youths, and seasonal users, among others. We examine ways in which formalization processes can secure diverse claims, and highlight the need for a better understanding of the social and ecological implications of existing land tenure before they are undermined by formalization.

     abstract = {Notwithstanding the modern description of property as a bundle of sticks, the conception of property as forms still exerts significant influence in legal analysis. This Article claims that both understandings of property are necessary and can indeed be incorporated into a realist approach to property. A realist perspective understands the forms of property as institutions: important default frameworks of interpersonal interaction that consolidate people's expectations and express law's normative ideals for core types of human relationships. For this reason, the existing forms of property are helpful as starting points of legal analysis. But as social institutions, the existing property forms are not accorded overwhelming normative authority. Rather, using the bundle metaphor, these property forms are subject to an ongoing normative (and properly contextual) reevaluation and possible reconfiguration. This Article presents the realist approach to property through analysis of United States v. Craft, a 2002 Supreme Court decision involving the vulnerability of marital property to the claims of one spouse's creditors. The conceptions of property presented in Craft as either forms or bundles are both riddled with flaws. This Article develops the competing approach of property as institutions and demonstrates how it can inform the resolution of conflicts between various types of creditors of one spouse and the nondebtor spouse. Property as institutions usefully focuses the legal analysis of these issues on the guiding principles of property governance in marriage and of legal accidents law, which regulates contradictory claims raised by parties with no contractual privity. Understanding property as institutions helps account for the numerus clausus principle, which prescribes that the forms of property are limited in number and standardized. It also refines the implications of this pervasive characteristic of property. This Article claims that, properly understood, the numerus clausus principle requires a purposive, rather than formalistic, legal discourse. It also shows that within the framework of property as institutions the numerus clausus principle leaves rather broad room for freedom of contract, allowing parties to opt out of most incidents of existing property forms.},

     abstract = {The relationship between private law adjudication (typified as the bipolar encounter between plaintiff and defendant) and social values usually associated with much broader settings (such as the pursuit of distributive justice by state legislation) is a perennial concern of legal theory. The task of this essay is to strike the middle-ground between the voices of private law autonomy and the total instrumentalization of private law for any desirable value, purpose, or state of affairs. I claim that neither autonomist theory nor its instrumentalist counterpart provides a satisfactory account of private law. Autonomist theory is implausible because private law rests on a thick perfectionist view of society and hence cannot claim to be neutral vis-à-vis social values. But unlimited instrumentalism is also misguided because, as autonomists insist, the bipolar structure of private law litigation indeed entails certain normative constraints. These two propositions yield the main conclusion of this essay: the normative infrastructure of any private law doctrine should be responsive both to bipolarity constraints on the one hand, and to social values appropriate to the pertinent category of human interaction on the other. The essay further explores the implications of this conclusion for three specific doctrinal issues: marital property, monetary remedies for breach of entitlements, and the right of entry (into property).},

abstract = {This longitudinal case study of residential development pressure in a village in Glasgow's urban fringe provides detailed insight into the different perspectives of key public, private and community interest groups, and exemplifies the conflict resolution process in this environment in the context of the new post-2006 planning system in Scotland. The paper is organised into six main parts. In part 1 the major actors in the residential development process are identified with specific attention focused on the house-builder and the local planner. In part 2 the post-2006 development planning and development management process in Scotland is explained in order to establish the legislative and procedural context for the case study. Part 3 provides a review of urban growth n the Glasgow metropolitan region. Part 4 sets the case study in local context by providing representative examples of development pressure and conflict resolution in the District. Part 5 comprises detailed examination of conflict over pressure for residential development in the village of Torrance from 1971 to the present day. This in depth analysis illuminates the main actors, agents and arguments involved in the conflict resolution process; explains the rationale for decisions reached on residential development in the village; and affords insight into contemporary debate over house-building in the metropolitan fringe around Scotland's cities. Finally, some conclusions are presented on the issues of fairness and sustainability in the land use planning system and the on-going conflict between private profit and public interest in the production of the built environment around the edge of Britain's cities.},

     abstract = {In light of the expansive interpretation of the "public use" requirement, the payment of "just compensation" remains the only meaningful limit on the government's eminent domain power and, correspondingly, the only safeguard of private property owners' rights against abusive takings. Yet, the current compensation regime is suboptimal. While both efficiency and fairness require paying full compensation for seizures by eminent domain, current law limits the compensation to market value. Despite the virtual consensus about the inadequacy of market compensation, courts adhere to it for a purely practical reason: there is no way to measure the true subjective value of property to its owner. Subjective value is neither observable nor verifiable to third parties and courts cannot rely upon owners' reports of the value they attach to their properties. To date, the challenge of screening truthful from exaggerated evaluation has proven insurmountable. This Article solves the undercompensation conundrum. It offers a novel self-assessment mechanism that enables the payment of full compensation at subjective value when private property is taken by eminent domain. Under the proposed mechanism, property owners would get to set the price of the property designated for condemnation. The government could then either take the property at the designated price or abstain, leaving the property subject to two new proposed restrictions. First, for the life of the owner, the property could not be sold for less than the self-assessed price, adjusted on the basis of the local housing price index. Second, the self-assessed price--discounted to take account of the peculiarities of property tax assessments--would become the new benchmark for the owner's property tax liability. This Article shows that under most conditions, these restrictions will induce honest reporting by owners while reducing the transaction costs created by the compensation process. The result is a dramatically more efficient law of eminent domain that is also far more respectful of private property rights.},

The real option approach takes into account this irreversibility and changes established conclusions for the reversible investment case. Under irreversibility, eminent domain efficiency is more sensitive to compensation rules than previously thought. Setting compensation equal to what market value would be in the absence of eminent domain—the approach taken in the \{US\} and many other countries—reduces efficiency relative to losing the ecological externality to private development. Compensating at the market value under eminent domain threat increases efficiency, but not as much as compensation at social value does. ",

It presents a functional explanation for why the legal system utilizes these two modalities of rights, grounded in the pattern of information costs associated with each modality. To test this theory, the Article examines four legal institutions that fall along the property/contract interface--bailments, landlord-tenant law, security interests, and trusts--in order to determine how the legal doctrine varies as the underlying situation shifts from in personam, to in rem, to certain relations intermediate between these poles. With respect to each institution, we generally find that in personam relations are governed by flexible default rules; in rem relations are governed by bright-line rules that impose immutable and standardized obligations; intermediate relations, as befits their intermediate level of information costs, feature a type and degree of standardization beyond pure contract but short of pure property.},

number = {1},

abstract ={In studying the characteristics that determine the public, nonprofit, and/or for-profit nature of organizations, public administration scholarship has elaborated upon the “dimensional” approach (e.g., Bozeman, Barry. 2007. Public values and public interest: Counterbalancing economic individualism. Washington, DC: Georgetown Univ. Press), to the point where it is now furnishing a rich body of theoretical and empirical material on organizational identity. Yet as Bozeman says, there was always another “complementary” approach to the same set of issues, namely the “core legal” approach which, as Bozeman, Barry, and Stuart Bretschneider (1994. The ‘publicness puzzle’ in organization theory: A test of alternative explanations of differences between public and private organizations. Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory 4:197–223) say, is “equally important.” This article revisits the legal approach, showing that it is as complex and theoretically motivated in its own way as the dimensional approach, and setting out its basic structure. Only once the core legal approach is seen as a more equal partner will it be possible to pursue Bozeman and Bretschneider's call for “studies employing both core and dimensional models,” in which the two are fully complementary, and the capacities of each are available for conceptualizing the identity of organizations—both when such identity is settled and when it is contested—and for predicting the consequences for organizational behavior that follow.},

We offer examples of how property rights systems vary along these dimensions and how they change over time. We illustrate the arguments with two contemporary empirical cases: the transition economies of Eastern and Central Europe, Russia, and China, and the transformation of intellectual property rights.},

Communitarian critics of capitalism trace its moral failure to the marketplace. Drawing on Aristotle's normative economics, this school maintains that production for gain corrodes society's moral fabric. I defend the democratic approach. Democratic critics accept the modern claim that markets are both efficient and liberating. Capitalist ownership relations are another matter, indicted because they constitute a form of private power over people's lives. I reconstruct the ethical core of the democratic school and contend that it offers a better understanding of the most objectionable aspects of capitalist economies while avoiding the dangers inherent in the communitarian approach.},

Neoclassical scholars lobby for a move toward private property rights, while other economists and historians defend the maintenance of customary land tenure. I argue that the development scholars' focus on the structure of property rights obscures a more fundamental problem of land reform--that of enforcement. Property rights will not inspire individual investment and economic growth unless political institutions give the ruler of a local community or nation-state sufficient coercive authority to silence those who advocate an alternative, more distributionally favorable property rights system. At the same time, political institutions must force the ruler to establish a credible commitment to that property rights system. I illustrate this theoretical argument through an analysis of property rights institutions in Akyem Abuakwa, a traditional state in colonial Ghana.},

author = "Matthew Hoffman",
abstract = "In 1999 the Scottish Parliament convened for the first time in almost 300 years and in response to long-standing popular discontent about highly concentrated land ownership passed the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. Quite in contrast to the emphasis that much of the international development literature and policy have placed on the importance of individual private ownership, Scotland's land reform promotes community ownership. Rather than breaking up large private estates, land reformers aim to keep these estates whole while transferring ownership of them to local communities. This study uses historical analysis and in-depth interviews to understand why this is being pursued as a rural development strategy in Scotland today. It finds that community ownership is intended not only to encourage the development of resources that private investors might otherwise ignore; but also to enable local communities to guide the development process. Whereas unfettered, market-driven entrepreneurship might generate increased wealth, but not necessarily benefit the local community, community ownership aims to make sure that wealth generated from the land remains within the community; that the benefits of development are evenly spread; that needed services are provided; that the population is maintained; and that resources are managed for the long-term benefit of the community. In this way the Scottish land reform represents a shift (or rather a broadening) of emphasis, from a focus on wealth creation to a recognition of the importance of effective local democratic governance.

% I have used this case in part as it contains a ship name. If you want a very good table of cases, ship names should be listed separately. Paul Stanley's Readme for OSCOLA describes this in more detail. 
%The year-essential=true is to prevent Latex from making what should be square brackets (e.g. [1940]) into curved brackets (e.g. (1940).) This is necessary whenever there is a `volume' input. Compare:
