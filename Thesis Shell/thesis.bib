	title = {Not Imminent in My Domain! County Leaders' Attitudes toward Eminent Domain Decisions},
	volume = {70},
	abstract = {Eminent domain is an urgent problem facing local government administrators and scholars throughout the United States. However, the literature is sparse regarding how local leaders make decisions on this hot-button issue. A 2006 Government Accountability Office report noted a lack of data about local government use of their eminent domain authority. A survey of county managers in North Carolina was conducted to redress this apparent knowledge gap. Although the findings are primarily generalizable only to other Dillon's rule states, such data demonstrate that eminent domain applies more often for narrow (public use) purposes, such as water and sewer systems, than for {\textbackslash}grqqbroad” (public good) purposes, such as economic development. Current and future property considerations also influence eminent domain decisions.[A] law that takes property from A, and gives it to B: It is against all reason and justice, for a people to entrust a legislature with such powers; and, therefore, it cannot be presumed that they have done it.

@article{somin07,
	title = {Controlling the Grasping Hand: Economic Development Takings after Kelo},
	volume = {15},
	abstract = {The Supreme Court’s controversial decision in Kelo v. City of New London upheld the condemnation of private property for purposes of economic development. This Article argues that Kelo was wrongly decided and that courts should forbid economic development takings. Part I analyzes the flaws of economic development takings generally. Such condemnations allow politically powerful interest groups to capture the condemnation process for the purpose of enriching themselves at the expense of the poor and politically weak. This Part also shows that the need to eliminate holdout problems that could block desirable assembly projects cannot justify permitting economic development takings. In most cases, private developers can prevent holdouts by such noncoercive methods as assembling property in secret and adopting precommitment strategies that prevent holdouts from using their bargaining power. Part {II} considers the major alternatives to a categorical ban. While these proposals are not without merit, none can prevent eminent domain abuse as effectively as forbidding the economic development rationale altogether. In Part {III}, I consider the Kelo case itself. In advocating broad deference to local governments on public use issues, the Kelo majority unfortunately ignored the serious defects in the political processes that control economic development takings. The Court’s analysis of history and precedent also has significant weaknesses. Nonetheless, Kelo actually represents a modest improvement on the Court’s previous public use decisions, by holding out the possibility of at least slightly greater judicial scrutiny. Part {III} also provides a very preliminary assessment of the political backlash against Kelo, showing that much of the proposed anti-Kelo legislation provides little or no real protection for property owners. Part {IV} strikes an additional note of caution, showing that even a categorical ban on economic development takings is not a comprehensive solution to the underlying problem of eminent domain abuse. A ban on economic development takings can potentially be circumvented in several ways, most notably because such bans still permit condemnations to alleviate blight. Courts in many states have already defined blight so broadly that the definition could encompass virtually any property.},

This oversight is particularly problematic in African studies. In sub-Saharan Africa the absence or weakness of secure property rights regimes in the countryside can have powerful consequences for multiparty dynamics. Land can become a patronage resource in ways that ignite destabilizing redistributive conflicts and threaten minority rights. By ignoring the design and character of underlying property regimes—or by assuming that the rules governing property are fixed, neutral, or essentially liberal in character—analysts have overlooked a fundamental source of illiberalism in many of Africa's multiparty systems. Côte d'Ivoire, where land politics have contributed to system-wide political breakdown, serves as a case in point.},

    abstract = {This Essay proposes a novel solution for "squaring the eminent domain circle" when large-scale, for-profit development projects require the assembly of land from numerous private property owners. Such "anticommons" situations may justify government intervention through eminent domain, yet they often leave landowners undercompensated. This may skew the incentives for initiating land development projects and lead to considerable injustice. Although the taking component of eminent domain may need to remain an involuntary nonmarket transaction, we propose a market-based mechanism for the compensation component in the form of a Special-Purpose Development Corporation (SPDC). An SPDC would acquire unified ownership of the land and the development project, and would offer condemnees a choice between receiving pre-project "fair market value" compensation or pro rata shares in the SPDC. This would make it more likely that compensation is closely linked to the true economic value of the land and, consequently, that land assembly projects are both more just and genuinely social welfare maximizing.},

    abstract = {Eminent domain for economic development is both attractive and appalling. States need the power to condemn because so much land in America is inefficiently fragmented. But public land assembly provokes hostility because vulnerable communities get bulldozed. Courts offer no help. The academic literature is a muddle. Is it possible to assemble land without harming the poor and powerless? Yes. This Article proposes the creation of Land Assembly Districts, or "LADs." This new property form solves the age-old tensions in eminent domain and shows, more generally, how careful redesign of property rights can enhance both welfare and fairness. The economic and moral intuition underlying LADs is simple: when the only justification for assembly is over-fragmentation of land, neighbors should be able to decide collectively whether their land will be assembled. Our legal theory solution is equally simple: use property law to retrofit communities with a condominium-like structure tailored to land assembly. Let's try giving those burdened by condemnation a way to share in its benefits and to veto projects they decide are not worth their while.},

     ISSN = {0017811X},
     abstract = {Why are many storefronts in Moscow empty, while street kiosks in front are full of goods? In this Article, Professor Heller develops a theory of anticommons property to help explain the puzzle of empty storefronts and full kiosks. Anticommons property can be understood as the mirror image of commons property. By definition, in a commons, multiple owners are each endowed with the privilege to use a given resource, and no one has the right to exclude another. When too many owners hold such privileges of use, the resource is prone to overuse - a tragedy of the commons. Depleted fisheries and overgrazed fields are canonical examples of this familiar tragedy. In an anticommons, according to this Article, multiple owners are each endowed with the right to exclude others from a scarce resource, and no one has an effective privilege of use. When too many owners hold such rights of exclusion, the resource is prone to underuse - a tragedy of the anticommons. Empty Moscow storefronts are a canonical example of the tragedy of underuse. Anticommons property may appear whenever governments define new property rights in both post-socialist and developed market economies. Once an anticommons emerges, collecting rights into usable private property bundles can be brutal and slow. The difficulties of overcoming a tragedy of the anticommons suggest that policymakers should pay more attention to the content of property bundles, rather than focusing just on the clairty of rights.},

% I have used this case in part as it contains a ship name. If you want a very good table of cases, ship names should be listed separately. Paul Stanley's Readme for OSCOLA describes this in more detail. 
%The year-essential=true is to prevent Latex from making what should be square brackets (e.g. [1940]) into curved brackets (e.g. (1940).) This is necessary whenever there is a `volume' input. Compare: 

@jurisdiction{hain,

keywords = {gb},
date = {1936},
court = {HL},
reporter = {Com. Cas.},
volume = {41},
pages = {350},}
%Here, the report requires curly brackets and so does not need the `essential=true' input. This all might seem quite cumbersome, but it really isn't: I simply inputted almost all my cases with the essential=true addition and then took it out where required.

%Note the `number' is the way of inputting neutral citations. 
%Note, further, that the pagination is set to paragraphs, so your pinpoints will take you to the paragraph number you input rather than the page.
