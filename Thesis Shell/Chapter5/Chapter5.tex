\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

Rules relating to land consolidation are found in many jurisdiction and they tend to play a crucial role in facilitating new forms of land use, especially in the context of agriculture. Consolidation rules may be specifically targeted at pooling together small parcels of land to create larger units, but usually the objective is more general and consolidation is used to refer to a variety of different mechanisms by which the state intervenes to reorganize the property structure in a given area to promote more efficient and rational use of the land.\footnote{For a survey of contemporary land consolidation rules in Norway we point to \cite{vittikainen2004}.}

The distinction between consolidation and land reform may sometimes be difficult to draw, but whereas land reforms tend to arise from centrally directed measures that apply generally within a jurisdiction and come about as the result of a special political initiative, consolidation usually denotes a more flexible framework where local communities are restructured in a way that aims to bring benefits to all owners and rights holders within that community. As such, consolidation rules may alleviate the need for new land reforms, and they may come to represent a ``bottom up" approach to the restructuring of real property.\footnote{Better references needed on the connection between land reform and consolidation.}

In the following, we adopt this view on the purpose of consolidation and we use the term to refer to a regulated process of land reorganization that come about as a result of a concrete, often local initiative, has a limited geographical scope, relies on the involvement of the local population, and seeks to promote the best interests of all the affected land users. Consolidation so understood serves an important function in many jurisdictions. 

It allows ownership structures to adapt gradually to the prevailing economic and social conditions, but it may also take on significance in the implementation of concrete development projects, particularly when such projects necessitate cooperation among several owners. This, in particular, is the use of consolidation that we aim to shed light on in the following, by giving a case-study of Norwegian law. Mechanisms for facilitating and organizing concrete development schemes do not form part of the historical core of consolidation rules in Norway, but the possibility of using consolidation to undertake concrete development projects is receiving increased attention and the scope of consolidation has been widened. This is reflected in a number of new provisions, most recently in the Land Consolidation Act 2013 which will take effect on 1 January 2016.\footnote{Act no 97 of 10 June 2013 relating to the determination and change of structures of ownership- and rights to real property etc.}

When land consolidation is used as a means to organize development projects it also becomes natural to view it as an alternative to expropriation, especially in cases when development has commercial potential and is meant to be carried out by companies operating for profit. Moreover, the controversy that often surrounds such cases further suggests that it should be explored to what extent processes of consolidation can replace expropriation as an implementation mechanism for development of this kind. As we will see, the principle of local participation and benefit sharing is more firmly entrenched in the rules and procedures that govern the consolidation process than in the processes that govern the use of expropriation. 

The contrast between expropriation and consolidation is particularly clear in Norwegian law, where a ``no loss" principle is enforced with regards to the latter, protecting all affected owners and rights holders. It states that the consolidation process should not leave any owner or rights holder worse off after consolidation. The aim of consolidation is to bestow a benefit on \emph{all} interested parties.\footnote{See Section 3 a) of the Land Consolidation Act 1979 (currently in force) and Section 3-18 of the Land Consolidation Act 2013. For a paper discussing the rule in more detail we point to \cite{rygg1998}. Rygg is also critical of what he sees as a development away from a strict interpretation of the no loss rule.} For instance, if ownership is highly fragmented, consolidation mechanisms may be used to exchange property between owners or to introduce joint ownership, but due to the no loss rule it will not be possible to use consolidation in order to deprive some owners of their property to the benefit of others.

In the following, we go on to map the differences between consolidation and expropriation in Norwegian law, starting with an overview of the land consolidation rules, focusing on the development towards giving these rules greater application in connection with concrete development schemes. We then study some cases of locally controlled hydro-power development where land consolidation was used as a means to organize projects involving many different owners and rights holders. We argue that these cases illustrate how the consolidation rules currently in place are well suited to meet local demands for participation and benefit sharing, more so than the existing framework regulating expropriation.

The structure of the chapter is as follows. In Section \ref{sec:2} we briefly present the basic rules regarding land consolidation in Norwegian law, including a presentation of the special consolidation courts used to administer the process. Then in Section \ref{sec:3} we go on to consider in more depth the rules relating to so-called \emph{use directives}, permitting the court to actively pursue development projects on behalf of, and in cooperation, with local owners. Use directives represent a form of compulsory cooperation which we believe deserves further attention in the context of land development, especially as an alternative to expropriation. We follow up with a case-study of hydro-power in Section \ref{sec:4}, and in Section \ref{sec:5} we contrast the use of directives with more commonly seen approaches to pooling of resources and commercial land development. In Section \ref{sec:6} we offer a conclusion.

\section{Land consolidation in Norway}\label{sec:2}

Rules regarding land consolidation are historically important in Norwegian law and they are widely relied on by land owners even today, especially in rural parts of the country. The first consolidation rules were included already in King Magnus Lagab√∏te's \emph{landslov} (law of the land) from 1274, the first piece of written legislation known to have been introduced at the national level in Norway.\footnote{See Chapter 4, Section 2 in \emph{Jordskifterettens stilling og funksjoner}, NOU 2002 no 9, report to the Department of Agriculture from special committee appointed by the King in Council 10 October 2000.} The earliest rules targeted jointly held rights in farming land, giving any owner or tenant farmer on that land an opportunity to demand apportionment that would give him exclusive rights on a parcel of land corresponding to his share of the joint rights.\footnote{The share in joint rights belonging to each individual farm was historically determined based on the amount of rent (``skyld") that each farmer paid to the land owner. However, following the union with Dennmark and especially after the advent of enlightened absolutism, tenant farmers in Norway increasingly bought their land from increasingly marginalized Danish land owners. Indeed, tenant farming became uncommon in Norway after the 18th Century, but the notion of skyld was kept as a measure of the share each farm had in the now jointly owned larger estate, and it is still relied on in various contexts, such as for the purpose of apportionment. References needed.}

Many of the rules currently in place were developed in the 19th Century. At this time, the main use of land consolidation was still to divide jointly owned land into parcels, but the relative importance of such measures increased greatly since it was seen as a necessary adjustment in an age when industrialization introduced a range of new and more efficient farming techniques. In particular, as changes in farming methods resulted in an increased need for capital in agriculture, full ownership came to be regarded as more favorable since it meant that better security could be offered to financial institutions.\footnote{References needed.} 

However, in some cases it was noted that full division of ownership might not be required and that use directives could be employed instead, to provide the individual farmers with clear rights of use over joint land. In addition to providing clarity and security for users, the rules introduced to facilitate this also created a legal framework for implementing development without altering the underlying structure of ownership, even in cases when development would require considerable pooling of resources and decision-making power. The rules were initially targeted at more rational organization of land use in agriculture, enabling rural communities to adapt to changing economic conditions without fundamentally altering them or leading to displacement or depopulation. Hence they were mostly relied on in connection with farming, and not commonly used to facilitate different kinds of development.

In recent years this has changed, and today use directives are increasingly applied also to organize development projects that are not associated with traditional farming. Moreover, many additional mechanisms of land consolidation have been introduced, all aiming in various ways to ensure better organization of land use and ownership. These mechanisms are administered by the \emph{consolidation court}, a special tribunal which has land consolidation as its sole task.\footnote{It appears to be a unique administrative unit in the European setting, although Austria have land tribunals that resemble it. References.} There are three main categories of consolidation tools that the court may use, and they are summarized in the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Apportionment of land}: Rules that empower the court to dissolve systems of joint ownership by apportioning to each estate a parcel corresponding to its share, or by reallocating property through exchange of land. This is the traditional form of land consolidation in Norway, and the main legislative basis for it is provided in Section 2 a-b) of the Land Consolidation Act 1979.
\item \emph{Delimitation of boundaries:} Rules that empower the court to determine, mark and describe boundaries between properties and the content and extent of different rights of use attached to the land. The main legislative basis for this form of consolidation is found in Section 88 of the Land Consolidation Act 1979.
\item \emph{Directives for use}: Rules that empower the court to prescribe rules for the use of jointly held land, and to organize such use, including setting up organizational units for carrying out specific development projects, as described in Section 2 c) and Sections 34-35 of the Land Consolidation Act 1979. 
\end{itemize}

In all cases, the consolidation court can only employ these tools when they are called on to do so by someone who is regarded as having a valid legal interest in the matter. Traditionally, this meant one of the owners of the land involved, but gradually the system have also come to recognize that others might have a legitimate interest in consolidation. This includes developers who have obtained planning permission for specific projects that require reorganization of property rights. The legal role of such actors is currently changing from passive to more active, and this development raises particular questions that we will return to below. For now we note that the traditional situation is that a consolidation process is initiated by one of the local owners of the land. It is still true, in particular, that consolidation is primarily a mechanism by which any one among the owners can work out what their legal position is, and, if the court agrees that it would be favorable to the use of the land, can ensure that the rights in the land are restructured.

The condition that restructuring only takes place when it is regarded as favorable is an additional condition that limits the court's authority to take action that involves apportionment and directives for use. To determine whether or not it has been met, the court will look to the current economic and political climate, and so the consolidation rules are \emph{dynamic}, capable of being adapted to the circumstances. In this regard the court is also influenced by what it regards as the prevailing public interests in property use, and recent developments in consolidation law stress the importance of this link, with recent reforms seeking to strengthen it.\footnote{See for instance Prop. 101 L (2012-2013) (report from the Department of Agriculture regarding the new Consolidation Act).}

However, the contextual nature of land consolidation has always been clear. We have already mentioned how the basic building blocks of the current system can be traced back to the influence of technological advances in farming and the modernization processes that Norwegian society underwent in the 19th Century. The law responded to these changes, and consolidation became a vitally important instrument for change and development in this period. It was also at this time that it was decided to establish a tribunal system for administering the process, first in the Land Consolidation Act from 1857 and then revised and developed further in acts from 1882 and 1950.\footnote{An overview of the history of consolidation law is given in Chapter 3 of Prop 101 L (2012-2013).} The procedural rules closely mimics those that pertain to the regular civil courts. This ensures that consolidation tools are only put to use if a court orders it, and only after a public hearing where all involved parties are given an opportunity to present their case, give supporting evidence, and to contradict each others' testimony. For a more detailed description of the consolidation court, we refer the reader to Section \ref{subsec:21} below.

The current system for land consolidation is based on the Land Consolidation Act 1979, but this act will be replaced in 2016 when the new Land Consolidation Act 2013 will take effect. The new act was passed on 10 June 2013, and while it does not introduce any dramatic changes to the law, it further widens the scope of consolidation, particularly with regards to directives for joint use, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:3} below. The new act also contains an explicit description of the purpose of land consolidation, which we now quote.\footnote{Act no 97 of 10 June 2013 relating to the determination and change of structures of ownership- and rights to real property etc. (henceforth the \emph{Land Consolidation Act 2013}). It will take effect on January 1 2016.}

\begin{quote}
Section 1-1 The purpose of the Act

The purpose of the act is to facilitate efficient and rational use of real property in the best interests of the owners, rights holders and society. This objective will be pursued by the land consolidation courts which will implement remedies for unpractical structures concerning ownership and use of property, ascertain and determine property boundaries, as well as decide appraisal disputes and other cases as pursuant by this and other acts.

The act also seeks to facilitate fair, responsible, quick and effective processing of cases in independent and impartial public courts that will operate in such a way as to enhance confidence in the consolidation process.
\end{quote}

This statement of purpose highlights how the new act incorporates and extends the trend towards giving the consolidation process wider scope, and we also notice how it is reiterated and emphasized that the process is to be tribunal in nature. We think it also indicates that consolidation is likely to become more important in the future, increasingly also outside the traditional agricultural setting within which the ancient body of law regulating it has hitherto developed.\footnote{For instance, following a change in the Land Consolidation Act 1979 in 2006, Land Consolidation may now also be called on in order to manage restructuring of ownership in urban areas, in connection with specific development schemes. This rule has been extended further in the new Act, and it will be interesting to see how the division of labor will be in the future, between planning authorities, regular courts and the land consolidation courts. \sjur{more references needed here, possibly a special paragraph on this.}}

It is now explicitly stated that the purpose of land consolidation is to make conditions of property use more favorable for all the affected owners and rights holders. Hence the new act accentuates how consolidation represents a form of interference that is fundamentally different from expropriation. As before, the consolidation court is not empowered to take action unless it is called on by one of the stakeholders in the property, see Section 1-5 of the Land Consolidation Act 2013. However, according to the new act, a developer who has obtained permission to expropriate is to be counted as a stakeholder in that land for the purposes of consolidation.\footnote{Previously, a developer was only regarded as a stakeholder in consolidation in some cases of public projects, c.f. Sections 5, 88 and 88 a) of the Land Consolidation Act 1979.} This further reflects how it is becoming increasingly natural to see land consolidation as an alternative to expropriation. It also flags how the relationship between expropriation and consolidation is now becoming an important topic in Norwegian land law.

In 2005 the Department of Agriculture made some comments in this regard, in connection with a revision of the current 1979 act that gave consolidation greater applicability in urban areas and with respect to implementing public plans.\footnote{See in particular Section 2 h-i) of the Land Consolidation Act 1979.} Some members of the preparatory committee had raised the concern that giving consolidation extended scope in this way would be problematic since it would encroach on expropriation law and effectively render consolidation a form of expropriation. The Department disagreed, commenting as follows.\footnote{See Chapter 3.3 of Ot.prp. no 78 (2004-2005), report to parliament from the Department of Agriculture regarding changes in the Land Consolidation Act 1979.}

\begin{quote}
The Department would like to point out that one of the main preconditions for consolidation is that a net profit is created for the land in question. This profit is then divided among the parties in an orderly fashion. Individually, the law also guarantees that no one suffers a loss, see Section 3 a). [...] \\ \\ In the Departments opinion, expropriation takes place on a different factual and legal basis. In cases of expropriation the public makes decisions that deprives the parties of economic value. The purpose then becomes to compensated them in accordance with Section 105 of the Constitution, not to increase the value of their land or the annual income they may derive from it.
\end{quote}

When preparing the new act, the Department of Agriculture reiterated this position but they did not reflect further on the question of the exact relationship between consolidation and expropriation. They observed, however, that changing the law so that expropriating parties could appear in consolidation cases was \emph{reasonable} since it would then be left up to the developer whether to make use of his permission to expropriate or to rely on consolidation instead.\footnote{See page 84 of Prop.101 L (2012-2013).} Indeed, it seems that in many cases, the well-organized and tightly regulated process of consolidation might be a more practical alternative for developers than the more fragmented rules and administrative bodies that come into play following traditional expropriation. 

However, it seems clear that the choice made by the expropriating party in this regard will tend to be even more important for the affected owners and rights holders. In particular, as the Department themselves made clear in the passage quoted above, it is an absolute precondition for implementation of any consolidation measures that alter the rights structure that they must serve to make the structure of ownership and use more favorable for \emph{everyone}. This, moreover, refers explicitly to the \emph{area within which consolidation takes place}, as stated in Section 3-3 of the new act. No similar rule is in place to protect the affected local area following expropriation. Moreover, the practices that have developed for dealing with consolidation cases are centered on the interests of the local owners and their land to an extent that is quite different from any procedure that is currently in place to facilitate development by use of expropriation.
For instance, the rule regarding expropriation that corresponds most closely to the no loss rule  
requires merely that the benefit to private and public interest exceeds the disadvantages \emph{overall}, not locally and certainly not for individual local owners.\footnote{See Section 2 of the Expropriation Act 1959.} 

%Clearly, a rule which demands that this must be the case for every single affected property offers a much greater level of protection, placing the overall effect on public and private interests in a secondary role compared to the effect on the land in question, and the effects on the rights currently effective on that land.
%Moreover, the no loss rule serves to give special protection to owners in consolidation cases. It is explicitly stated already in the 1979 act and prevents any consolidation measures from being carried out if the financial loss or disadvantage to any individual property outweighs the benefits, see Section 3-18 of the Land Consolidation Act 2013, c.f., Section .... of the Land Consolidation Act 1979.

However, we also notice that the strict consolidation rules do not serve as a restriction on \emph{what} kind of development should be carried out, only on \emph{how} it should be organized. The former question is left to the planning authorities, and the consolidation courts must always base their decisions on existing public regulation of property use.\footnote{In Section 3-17 of the Land Consolidation Act 2013 it is explicitly stated that the consolidation court cannot prescribe solutions that are not in keeping with such regulation. However, it is also made clear that the consolidation court itself can apply for necessary planning permissions on behalf of the owners and the land in question.} Hence if the public interest suggests a particular form of land use, the fact that a planning decision detailing development of such use is implemented through consolidation does not entitle the court to review the plans themselves, going against the public interest. But it \emph{does} introduce an obligation, emerging at the time of implementation, to turn specifically to the interests of original owners and rights holders and to look for solutions that minimize the burden and maximizes the benefit for all the involved parties.

The rules that give the consolidation court authority to give directives of use are particularly relevant in this regard, and we return to them in Section \ref{sec:3} below. First we will present the consolidation process itself. It seems, in particular, that the procedural guarantees resulting from the fact that this process is organized as a tribunal are in themselves an important factor to consider when looking at consolidation as an alternative to expropriation.

\subsection{The consolidation process and the consolidation courts}\label{subsec:21}

A consolidation case is usually initiated by an owner or a permanent rights holder.\footnote{See Section 5, Paragraph 1 of the Land Consolidation Act 1979.} The request for consolidation measures is to be directed at the relevant district consolidation court, one of the 34 district courts for land consolidation that have been set up by the King in accordance with Section 7 of the Land Consolidation Act 1979. The request is meant to include further details about the affected properties, the owners and rights holder involved, as well as the specific issues that consolidation should address. But the requirements in this regard are not usually interpreted very strictly and the district consolidation court will often take on quite some responsibility for further clarifying what the case should encompass, more so than in civil disputes.\footnote{References needed.} Even so, the court is entitled to reject the request due to technical shortcomings, following the same rules as those which applies to civil disputes.\footnote{See Section 12, Paragraph 2 of the Land Consolidation Act 1979, which refers to Section 16-5 of the Civil Dispute Act 2005}

If the court decides that the request is well-formed and that it includes sufficient detail to permit consideration of the substance, they go on to prepare public hearings, following the rules set out in Chapter 3 of the Land Consolidation Act 1979. These rules mirror those that are in place for civil hearings in general, including the duty to inform affected parties (Section 13), the parties' right to present their claims, and their duty and right to give testimony and provide evidence supporting it (Sections 15, 17 a) and 18). As in civil cases, the decision is usually only reached after at least one hearing in which the parties are present and permitted to contradict the evidence provided and the testimony given by other parties. However, unlike in civil cases, the main hearing typically takes place on the disputed land itself, and consists in mapping and clarifying the prevailing conditions aided by visual inspection. Moreover, a consolidation case will usually not take the form of a two-party adversarial process, but rather as a multi-party discussion where the court interacts with a large number of interested parties who may have a range of common as well as conflicting interests. Usually, consolidation cases involve at least 10 or more different parties, and in some cases there can be hundreds. In addition, it is quite common that the parties are not represented by legal council, but rather take an active part in the process themselves.\footnote{References needed.}

The request for consolidation will be the court's point of departure when assessing the case, but the court is not bound by the claims put forth in it, or by the claims put forth by the other parties. This again marks a differences with most cases of civil dispute. With a few exceptions explicitly listed in statute, the consolidation court may decided to use any measure that it deems suitable to ensure a favorable structure of rights and ownership for the future. However, there is some restriction placed on the court in that the measures taken must be regarded as \emph{necessary} in light of considerations based on the original request.\footnote{See Sections 26 and 29 of the Land Consolidation Act 1979.} So while the court should remain focused on the issues raised by the parties, it should be free to address these issues using the tools they deem most suited for the job. The consolidation court, in particular, is meant to be a general ``problem solver", more so than the ordinary civil courts.

When a decision is reached, the rules in Section 17 and 22 of the 1979 act ensure that the parties are notified and that the decision is presented and argued for in keeping with the rules of the Civil Dispute Act 2005. The appropriate form of the decision will depend on its content. A regular civil ruling is the form used for decisions that only involve ascertaining the boundaries between properties, while a special ``consolidation decision" is the form relied on to implement apportionment and directives of use. The difference becomes clear as soon as we consider the appeals procedure; while civil rulings are dealt with by the regular courts of appeal, the consolidation decisions can only be appealed to one of 4 designated consolidation courts of appeal.\footnote{See Section 61 of the Land Consolidation Act 1979.} 

In the latter case, the procedural rules remain largely the same in the consolidation court of appeal, meaning also that there is a new assessment of all aspects of the case.\footnote{See Section 69 of the Land Consolidation Act 1979.} When the case is concluded here, however, it can only be appealed on the grounds that it is based on an incorrect understanding of the law, or that procedural mistakes have been made. In this case, the ordinary appeal courts have authority, with the Supreme Court being the last instance of possible appeal.\footnote{See Section 71 of the Land Consolidation Act 1979.}

From the brief overview of the process given above, we see that consolidation cases are different from other civil cases in that they have fundamentally different scope. A consolidation case is not primarily centered on deciding the merits of individual claims, but rather at introducing structures of ownership and rights that will prove favorable in general. In this respect the process has an administrative character. However, the fact that it is organized more or less like a regular civil dispute means that the protection of each affected party, and the influence of the local rights holders as a group, is much stronger than what would tend to be the case if these decisions were made by regular administrative bodies.

Given this context of arbitration, it is not surprising that the judges appointed to the consolidation courts are required to have a special skill set, different from that of regular civil law judges. In fact, consolidation judges are required to have successfully completed a special masters level degree in consolidation, which is not a law degree at all but a separate form of education.\footnote{See Section 7, Paragraph 5 of the Land Consolidation Act 1979. The degree in question is currently offered only at the Norwegian College of Life Sciences and Agriculture.} 

The consolidation court also relies on the participation of lay judges who sit alongside the specialist judge.\footnote{See Section 8 of the Land Consolidation Act 1979.} These judges are appointed by the specialist judge from a committee of laymen that are elected by the local municipalities in accordance with Section 64 of the Courts Act 1915.\footnote{See Section 8 of the Land Consolidation Act 1979.} In the district courts, the specialist judge usually sits with two appointed lay judges which he chooses himself from among members of the the relevant local committees. In the court of appeal, the specialist sits with 4 laymen, and in complicated cases 4 laymen may also be called on in the district courts, but only if one of the parties requests it.\footnote{See Section 9, Paragraph 2 of the Land Consolidation Act 1979.} To the extent possible, the appointed laymen should have special knowledge of the issues raised by the case, but they are drawn from the general population.\footnote{See Section 9, Paragraph 5.}

Summing up, we observe that the consolidation process has both administrative and adversarial characteristics. While the content and scope of the court's decision will often have an administrative flavor and is not primarily directed at settling any specific dispute, the process is judicial. Hence everyone is entitled, and to some extent even \emph{obliged}, to have his voice heard and to partake in the process. Moreover, while the process is guided and overseen by the court, it is fundamentally based on considerations arising from the interests of the parties. However, this interest is always interpreted in light of prevailing notions of what counts as favorable and rational property use. Importantly, in relation to this latter assessment, the court will look beyond the interests of the individual owners. The court will pose the question with regards to the use of the land as such, drawing on its understanding of the relevant economic, social and political conditions.\footnote{References needed.} But the decisions made are always prepared using information that is retrieved and discussed in public hearings, so the affected parties will take part in discussions that may also address more overreaching concerns about the form of land use that should be regarded as favorable for the area in question.

To flag the dual nature of the consolidation process it is tempting to designate it as a process of judicially structured \emph{deliberation}. The final decision-making authority is granted to the court, but the court is required to act on behalf of the rights holders, in the best interests of their land, and based on the information that they themselves provide. This particular form of decision-making based on multi-party deliberation is interesting in its own right, as it provides a template for management of land that seems capable of catering both to the idea of public oversight and control as well as to the idea of local participation. In addition to this, it seems to be a form of land management that might be especially suitable as a means to implement concrete projects undertaken in the public interest, particularly when these would otherwise appear to adversely affect individual land owners and local communities.

This is of particular interest in mixed economies such as seen in Norway, where decisions regarding development and use of property are typically made by the public but carried out by private property owners. In many cases, implementation of public policy requires some form of reorganization of ownership and rights structures, the most common being a pooling of resources from many different owners. Such processes have tended to be implemented rather crudely, by displacing the original owners in favor of commercial companies who serve as state agents. This relies on the use of expropriation, and it typically completely deprives the original owners of any chance to take part in the future development of the land. The land consolidation rules allows us to consider alternative means of implementation in such cases. 

They allow us to ask whether a more measured approach might be sufficient, allowing the original owners to retain their rights, but restructuring them using consolidation mechanisms. This question is particularly interesting to consider due to the high levels of tension often associated with cases of commercial expropriation, where companies operating for profit benefit from implementing public plans. Critics argue that such uses of expropriation are both unfair in themselves and also destabilizing in that they raise doubts abut the true motives behind specific acts of public planning.\footnote{References needed.} In particular, it seems that in a system of land management where development is organized in this way commercial companies will have much to gain from attempting to exert influence over the planning process, particularly if they can also succeed in being granted permission to expropriate property rights that they would otherwise have to acquire on an open market. However, to counter critics it may appear easy to argue from necessity, by pointing out that the system is the best known alternative for efficient and rational economic development in a system based on public control over planning and private rights to property.

In relation to this debate it seems that the consolidation procedure takes on particular relevance. It may point to an alternative, a system of public-private development where the original owners and local communities are better integrated into the process. Moreover, it allows us to introduce an additional conceptual layer between the planning stage and the implementation step, a layer of management devoted to translating public plans into concrete action by orderly restructuring of existing ownership patterns. This, in particular, might be a layer of administration that deserves more attention and more fine-grained tools than those currently offered in systems relying on expropriation. Clearly identifying such a consolidation layer in property management might also make for a cleaner delineation between commercial implementation on the one hand, governed by the market, and public planning on the other, governed by administrative law and political bodies. 

In the next section we argue that Norwegian consolidation law already include tools that make it possible to view consolidation in this light. The rules that we believe warrant this conclusion are the rules relating to joint use directives, briefly mentioned above. We present them in more detail below, noting that recent changes in consolidation law give them wider applicability in relation to concrete development projects. 

\section{Compulsory cooperation in consolidation law: Directives for joint use, joint action and joint investment}\label{sec:3}

In accordance with Section 2 c) of the Land Consolidation Act 1979 the consolidation court can give directives regarding the use of land which involves more then one property. Typically this will target land or land rights that are owned jointly or for which some form of shared use has already been established. However, if the court finds that there are \emph{special reasons} for giving joint use directives, it can do so even if there is no prior connection between the different rights and properties in question.\footnote{See Section 2 c), Paragraph 2 of the Land Consolidation Act 1979.} Traditional examples include directives for the shared use of a private road which crosses several different properties, or regulation of hunting that takes place across property boundaries.

The joint use rules emerged as an alternative to apportionment of jointly owned property, a more subtle and less invasive measure that could often give rise to the same positive effect as a full division of ownership, but without leading to unwanted fragmentation of control and use of property. Hence in the now repealed Land Consolidation Act 1950 it was stated that joint use directives should be the \emph{primary} mechanism of consolidation, and that apportionment should only take place if such directives were deemed insufficient to reach the goal of creating more favorable conditions for the use of the land.\footnote{References needed.} In the 1979 act the two mechanisms were formally put side by side, but in cases that are motivated by a specific planned use of the land in question, directives will obviously still be the main tool relied on by the court.

Moreover, there has been a gradual increase in the willingness of the court to rely on use directives to facilitate \emph{new development} on the land, not just as a means to regulate an existing activity. In parallel with this development, the consolidation court has gradually come to take on cases that pertain to organization of land use that was previously thought to lie outside its area of competence. The more restricted view on use directives and on the function of consolidation in general is reflected in the way the 1979 act lists a range of different concrete circumstances in which such directives might be applied.\footnote{See Section 35 of the Land Consolidation Act 1979.} The list is not understood to be exhaustive however, and the courts have gradually come to feel less deterred by it and more willing to consider new types of cases.\footnote{References needed.}

Hence in the new act of 2013, the list is replaced by an explicit general rule which makes it clear that the  consolidation courts have the authority to give directives whenever they regard this to be favorable to the properties involved.\footnote{See Section 3-8 of the Land Consolidation Act 2013.} In addition to this, the new act also introduces a general rule which gives the court authority to \emph{set up} systems of joint ownership when a joint use directive is deemed insufficient.\footnote{See Section 3-5 of the Land Consolidation Act 2013.} Hence in the new act apportionment and pooling of property is on equal footing, although a priority rule is introduced for the latter; pooling will only be considered if directives of joint use are regarded as an insufficient means to ensure more favorable conditions. Moreover, the new act maintains the principle that directives regarding the joint use of land for which there are no existing joint rights can only be given if there are special reasons.

This requirement is not intended to be very strict, however, and the Department of Agriculture was initially inclined to remove it. However, it was eventually decided that it should be kept in order to flag that there two distinct questions that arise in such cases. The court must first consider the question of whether or not joint use is in itself desirable, \emph{before} it goes on to consider how to best organize such use.\footnote{For a discussion on this see page 140-141 of Prop. 101 L (2012-2013).}

In addition to giving directives prescribing how joint use is to be organized, the consolidation court may also give rules compelling the owners to take joint action to help facilitate better realization of the potential inherent in the land. Rules to this effect were first introduced in the 1979 act, in Section 2 e) and Sections 42-44. These rules only pertain to joint action by property owners (see Section 34 a), and they have wider scope in relation to specific case types (Sections 43 and 44). Following the new act, however, the consolidation courts will have authority to prescribe joint action also for right holders, and the special rules listing concrete circumstances will be replaced by a general joint action rule.\footnote{See Section 3-9 of the Land Consolidation Act 2013.} This broadens the scope of these rules in accordance with the general spirit of the new act. Indeed, when they commented on this change in the law, the Department noted that the rules in question have been widely used following their introduction in 1979 and that applying them is now one of the core responsibilities of the consolidation court.\footnote{See page 146 of Prop. 101 L (2012-2013).}

We note that joint action directives can include prescriptions for joint investments.\footnote{See Section 3-9 of the Land Consolidation Act 2013.} On the one hand this means that such directives can be used to facilitate capital intensive new development, but it also raises the question of the extent to which it is legitimate to rely on compulsion in this regard, directed towards individual owners of property. The extent of the joint actions and investments required to undertake development projects can easily become quite burdensome for these individuals, and this is especially likely to arise as a concern in cases where the land lends itself well to large- scale commercial development.

The 1979 act attempts to resolve this in Section 34 b) and in Section 42. The former states that if joint actions or investments may come to involve``great risk", the court must set up two \emph{distinct} organizational units to undertake it. First, the rights needed to undertake the scheme will be pooled together and managed by an owners' association, and then, to undertake the scheme itself, a cooperative company structure will be set up on behalf of the owners. Hence the risk is diverted away from the individual owners onto a company controlled by them. This company will be entitled to any potential profit from the scheme, but it will also be required to pay compensation to the owner' association on terms established by the parties themselves, with the help of the court.\footnote{See Section 34 b) of the Land Consolidation Act 1979.} Moreover, the owners are entitled to shares in this company proportional to their share of the relevant rights in the land, as determined by the consolidation court. An owner is not obliged to take part in the undertaking by acquiring such shares, but he will benefit from membership in the owners' association regardless of whether or not he chooses to do so.

After this brief survey of the rules, we conclude that the land consolidation courts in Norway already have all the tools they need to organize large scale development projects on behalf of local owners. Moreover, the process of consolidation means that they must do so in a way that enables the original owners to retain considerable decision-making power as well as the right to any commercial benefit that may result from the development. Hence the rules currently found in consolidation law adds weight to the claim that and consolidation might point to an alternative and possibly fruitful way of implementing development projects in a system which presupposes that development takes place through commercial initiatives on the basis of public  planning and control. In particular, the system already provide the tools needed to organize
large scale development even when it requires considerable reorganization of land rights and diversification of risk. Consolidation may therefore become an alternative way of pooling together fragmented rights for the purpose of development, without displacing the original owners in favor of commercial companies who have no prior connection to the local community in which development takes place.

In addition to this, we observe that the consolidation rules also point to a form of implementation that will allow the public to exercise \emph{more} extensive oversight and control. Not only is the position of the original owners much better protected under this system, but it also greatly \emph{curbs} the power and influence of commercial forces with no prior connection to the land. Hence it must be expected that implementation through consolidation is better suited also to serve the social and political aims which originally motivated the underlying planning decision. Indeed, commercial development through consolidation give the public a greater say in the implementation stage; after all, the development is organized as a cooperative, and the company structure is set up and regulated by the courts who is obliged to consider also the public and societal interests in land use.

In addition to this, we recall that after the new act takes affects, both planning authorities and commercial developers may take up a role as formally recognized parties in the consolidation process. This seems particularly useful in connection with large scale industrial development, as it might otherwise be hard to implement such projects successfully. In these cases, then, the consolidation system sets up an arena for interaction and deliberation between the three main groups of stakeholders: the public, the local owners and the commercially motivated developers. Such an arena is so far missing at the implementation stage of big development projects, while recent controversies regarding expropriation suggest that it might come to serve an important function.

It remains unclear to what extent the consolidation rules will actually be used in this way. But as we will see in the next section, consolidation is beginning to emerge as an important means for organizing local hydro-power development. On the theoretical side, then, it is also unclear to what extent original owners may \emph{demand} that the rules are put to use. For instance, may an owner request consolidation to prevent a permission to expropriate from being implemented? It will be interesting to see how the Norwegian legal systems will deal with this and related questions, after the new act takes effect in 2016.

We conclude this section by addressing a new special rule that has been included in the new act, and which is specifically targeted at the planning authorities, encouraging them to make use of consolidation to achieve  greater fairness in public planning. The new rules are contained in Chapter 5 of the new act and they target benefit that arises from planning in cases when the benefit appears to fall disproportionately on some owners. Such cases of ``windfall" benefit due to public plans are often flagged as problematic, and they arise with particular frequency in systems based on commercial implementation. For example, if one parcel of land is designated for housing and some neighboring land is designated as a playground, it might easily come to be seen as unfair that a considerable financial benefit falls to the owner of the land designated for housing, while the playground owner is left with virtually nothing.

Following a change of the Consolidation Act in 2006 which has been further extended in the new act, the law now makes it possible for the planning authorities to decide that apportionment of the \emph{benefit} arising from the plan may be carried out by the consolidation courts.\footnote{See Section 3-30 of the Land Consolidation Act 2013 and Section 12-7 nr. 13 of the Planning and Buildings Act 2008.} When doing so, the consolidation court will follow the same procedure as in other cases, and it will allocate the benefit arising from the plan based on an assessment of the development potential of the different parcels. Importantly, the court will consider this question independently, and the decision will not be based on the particular manner in which the plan dictates that development is to be carried out. For instance, if the land used for the playground could just as well have been used for housing, the court may decide that the rights to housing development is to be shared equally between the two properties. On the other hand, if there is some independent reason why the playground property is not suited for housing, the court will reduce this property's share in the housing development correspondingly.

The court can implement solutions such as this more effectively and rationally by applying the other tools that it has available. For instance, if the the owner of he playground is entitled to an equal share in housing, then apportionment can be used to actually provide him with such a share, trading it for a corresponding share in the playground. However, if such material reallocation of development rights prove unfeasible, the new act also opens up for a solution where the benefit sharing is implemented using financial compensation.\footnote{See Section 3-32 of the Land Consolidation Act 2013.}

To sum up, we have seen in this section that directives of use rules are highly versatile and may be used 
to organize extensive projects of land development on behalf of original owners. This form of development makes it possible for original owners to maintain their interest in the land, it can prevent the need for expropriation, and it may give the public a greater opportunity to exert influence and control over how their planning decisions are implemented in practice. In the next section we consider in depth the particular case of hydro-power, where the consolidation courts have recently started to make use of a wide arsenal of its tools to ensure that development can be carried out in this way. We think this case-study sheds further light on consolidation as an alternative to expropriation, and further strengthens the argument that directives of use issued by a consolidation court can in many cases obliterate the need for depriving local people of their resources to implement public development plans.

\section{Compulsory cooperation for local development of hydro-power}\label{sec:4}

In this section we will look at four recent cases in detail, all of which involved directives of use for hydro-power development by original owners. The waterfalls dealt with in these cases are all located in the county of \emph{Hordaland}, in south-western Norway. Three of the cases involved small-scale hydro-power which some of the owners wanted to develop themselves, while the fourth was a case when the owners were also considering a larger development which would involve cooperation with an external energy company. The cases are particularly interesting because we have access to data on how the process of consolidation, and the outcome, was perceived by the owners themselves. Interviews were conducted and used in a recent master thesis on land consolidation which is devoted to the study of how consolidation measures is now increasingly being used to facilitate hydro-power development \cite{master}.

In the following we first present each case separately, focusing on those issues that were raised regarding how to organize development, the solutions prescribed by the court, and the subsequent reception among the parties. We then assess this from the point of view of developing a better understanding of compulsory cooperation as an alternative to expropriation. We conclude with some unresolved questions, particularly regarding those situations when the court is called on to resolve disagreement regarding how the development itself should be organized. These are the cases when the relationship between consolidation law and other legal frameworks, such as company law, planning law, and water law, becomes pressing, and there are many unresolved questions.

\subsection{The case of \emph{Vika}}

The case was brought before the consolidation court in 2005, by owners who all agreed that hydro-power development should be pursued.\footnote{Haugalandet og Sunnhordland jordkifterett, case no 1210-2005-0014.} The owners disagreed on how to organize the owners' association, and on how the shares in this association were to be divided among the different properties involved, 15 in total. The main principle was agreed upon from the start, however, namely that the owners would rent out their waterfall to a separate development company which every owner would have a right (but not a duty) to take part in. 

The parties in \emph{Vika} were highly involved in the consolidation process, and the statutes for the owners' association were based on suggestions made by the owners themselves. The main point of disagreement concerned how the shares in this association should be allotted, a question that was made more difficult by the fact that some owners benefited from old water-mill rights in the river. In the end, the consolidation court landed on the view that these rights were tied to the form of use relevant at the time they were established, and did not regard them as having any financial value. Hence these rights were extinguished without compensation, as provided for in Sections 2, 36 and 38 in the Land Consolidation Act 1979.

There was also some disagreement about whether the number of votes in the owners' association should be tied to the number of shares belonging to each owner, or if the owners should simply be allotted one vote each, irrespectively of their share in the waterfall. The consolidation court went for the first option, but the way in which they allotted shares in the owners' association deserves special mention. In particular, the court decided to take into account that some additional water entered the waterfall from smaller rivers where only a sub-group of the owners had waterfall rights. These owners' share in the association was increased accordingly, and this is surprising in light of Norwegian water law, as water rights are otherwise not tied to where the water comes from, but arises solely from the rights one has in the waterfall itself. 

The statutes of the owners' association also contains a second interesting provision, based on a suggestion made by the owners. It is a rule to the effect that all rights in the association are to be tied to the larger agricultural properties that give rise to them, and that they can not be divided from these properties and transferred to new owners separately. In Norway, such division of agricultural land would in any event require permission from the local municipality.\footnote{See Section 12 of the Land Act 1995.} In recent years, however, this protection of farming communities has grown weaker in practice, and it was the view of the owners in \emph{Vika} that a dissociation of water rights from underlying agricultural land should be forbidden altogether.

According to \cite{master}, interviews conducted with the parties demonstrated that a general consensus had developed whereby the land consolidation procedure was seen as a success. It allowed for an orderly and fair decision-making process regarding the conflicts that had arisen, and it was based on continuous interaction between the owners and the court, where everyone felt they had been given an opportunity to have his voice heard. Initially, tensions among the owners had been high, but the consolidation process had served to alleviate them. Some owners also pointed to the fact that the main hearing had been physically conducted in the local community, in a meeting hall that was familiar to the owners. This also gave them a feeling that they were meant to actively partake in the decision-making process. 

When the interviews were conducted, some 5 years after the case was concluded, the owners also appears to agree that the association was working as intended and that the climate of cooperation among the owners was good. The hydro-power scheme itself had been completed in 2008, yielding an annual production of around 15 GWh per year, providing enough energy for around 700 households. Moreover, following the experience of land consolidation, a culture of deliberation towards consensus had developed among the owners, and great emphasis had subsequently been placed on attempting to find common ground and to reach agreement on important issues. This was reflected, for instance, in the fact that the owner who contributed the land for the power station was given a generous annual fee, in addition to his compensation as a waterfall owner. According to \cite{master}, this fee exceeds what he would likely get if this decision had been left to the discretion of the consolidation court. Hence it reflected a premium that the owners were now willing to pay to ensure agreement and a continued good climate for cooperation.

All in all, we agree with \cite{master} that the case of \emph{Vika} serves as an example of how land consolidation can empower local communities and may enable them to embark on substantial development projects.

\subsection{The case of \emph{Oma}}

The second case we will consider is the case of \emph{Oma}, which was brought before the courts in 2006.\footnote{Nord- og Midthordaland jordskifterett, case no 1200-2006-0015.} In this case there were four involved properties. The owners of three of them, $A,B$ and $C$, wanted to develop hydro-power, while the fourth, owner $D$, was opposed to the development. Rather than attempting to expropriate the necessary rights from owner $D$, owners $A,B$ and $C$ took the case to the consolidation court. They argued that development would benefit all the properties involved, and also pointed out that a more restricted project, which would not make use of owner $D$'s rights, would be less economical. Hence in their view, the consolidation court should compel $D$ to cooperate in a joint scheme. Owner $D$ protested, arguing that the project would not economically benefit him, and that it would also be to the detriment of his plans to build cottages for holiday dwellers in the same area.

The case of \emph{Oma} differs from that of \emph{Vika} in that the question of whether it was appropriate to use compulsion was more prominent. In particular, this aspect came up already in relation to the question of whether or not hydro-power development should be pursued at all. As we discussed in Section \ref{sec:3}, the fact that some owners do not desire development does not prevent the consolidation court from putting directives in place to facilitate it, but the courts often exercise restraint in such cases. In \emph{Oma}, however, the court agreed with the majority of the owners argued that an owners' association with compulsory membership should be set up. In doing so, the court relied on Section 2 c) of the Land Consolidation Act 1979. To justify the use of compulsion against $D$, the court first observed that joint development of hydro-power would benefit all the properties in question, including $D$. Then they commented specifically on owner $D$'s plans for building of cottage homes, noting first that he was unlikely to be given planning permission, and secondly that hydro-power would not in any event adversely affect such plans in any significant way. Moreover, the court noted that while owner $D$'s rights were relatively minor, they were quite crucial for the profitability of the project, particularly because owner $D$ controlled the best location for the construction of a dam to collect the water used in the scheme. Overall, the court's conclusion was that a joint hydro-power scheme would be a better option for everyone than a project that did not include owner $D$'s property.

The question then arose as to how the shares in the owners' association, and the right to rent that would go with it, should be divided among the owners and their land. In regards to this question, the court departed significantly from one of the basic principles that have been entrenched in Norwegian water-law since the early 20th Century. The principle in question states that no right to hydro-power can be derived from being in possession of land suitable for the construction of dams or other facilities necessary to exploit the waterfalls.\footnote{The principle was is reflected in Supreme Court decisions as early as \emph{Herlandsfossen} and \emph{Drammenselven}, Rt. 1922 p. 489 and Rt. 1923 p. 185 respectively, and has been maintained consistently ever since.} But the land consolidation court broke with this principle in the case of \emph{Oma}, deciding instead to set the value of the land designated for construction of a dam and a power station to represent $6 \%$ of the total value of the rights that went into the owners' association. The proportion of financial benefit and decision-making power awarded to the unwilling owner $D$ thus increased accordingly, since these right were all held by him. In fact, his share went from $1.75 \%$ to $7.75 \%$, so the consolidation process itself led to a situation where he would have a far greater incentive for supporting the development. In many ways, the decision in \emph{Oma} was more to the benefit of owner $D$ than any other among the involved parties. If the rights in question had been expropriated, for instance, he would be given next to nothing in compensation and would lose his rights forever. Instead, the solution prescribed by the consolidation court gave him a lasting and substantial interest in local hydro-power.

According to \cite{master}, interviews with the parties shows how the process and outcome of consolidation in \emph{Oma} served to create a much better climate for further cooperation among the parties. Indeed, when the interviews where conducted, 4 years after the courts' decision, owner $D$ had changed his mind and was now in favor of the development. Moreover, he had also decided that he wanted to take part in the development company. He was not obliged to do so, but his right to take part was encoded in the deal with the development company, as detailed in the statutes of the owners' association and in keeping with Section 34 b) no 3 of the Land Consolidation Act 1979.

The owners all reported that the consolidation process had been very successful and that the court had listen to them, allowing everyone to have their voices heard. Moreover, some owners reported that the court had cleverly maintained a ``birds eye view" on the best way to develop the land in question, ensuring both long terms benefit to all involved properties as well as creating an improved climate for cooperation and mutual understanding. The consensus was that making concessions to owner $D$ was appropriate and had been in the interest of all the involved parties. In 2011 the hydro-power project in \emph{Oma} was completed and today its output is roughly 3 GWh per year.

We think the case of \emph{Oma} serves as a good illustration of how consolidation can be an effective instrument for facilitating locally controlled development, also in cases when this requires the use of compulsion against some owners. Interestingly, in this case the successful outcome appears to be partly due to the fact that the consolidation court actively used its discretionary powers when deciding how to organize joint use. This power allowed them to deviate from established rights-based legal doctrine and adopt a more context-dependent approach, pursuing solutions that suited the situation better. Interesting legal questions arise in this regard, particularly regarding the competence that the consolidation court has in such cases, and the extent to which decisions can be made subject to review by the normal courts on the basis that they do not follow established principles and practices. For instance, one may ask what would have happened if the majority owners in \emph{Oma} had appealed the decision to the regular courts on the basis that $D$ was awarded too many shares in the owners' association. Would this be regarded as a question of the court's interpretation of the law regarding the owners' \emph{rights}, or would it be regarded as a discretionary decision regarding the best way to organize development? In the first case, the decision would almost certainly have been overturned on appeal, but in the latter case it would likely be beyond reproach.

A second interesting question that arises is whether or not consolidation can work as well as it did in \emph{Oma} in cases where conflicts run more deeply, or where the parties favoring development are a minority among the owners. The next two cases we consider shed some light on this issue.

\subsection{The case of \emph{Dj√∏nno}}

This case was brought before the courts in 2006, by a local owner $A$ who wanted to develop hydro-power in a small river crossing his land, the so called \emph{Kvernhusbekken}.\footnote{Indre Hordaland Jordskifterett, case no 1230-2006-0010.} This owner wanted the court to help him implement a hydro-power project, by compelling the other owners, $B, C$ and $D$, to rent out their share in the necessary rights on terms dictated by the court. The starting point for the other owners was that they did not want any hydro-power development at all, and they were not willing to rent out their rights to owner $A$ or any other developer. There was also a dispute regarding the ownership of the waterfall rights, with $A$ believing initially that he controlled a large majority. It soon became clear that this was not the case, and before the main hearing the parties agreed that the waterfall in question was owned jointly with shares divided according to each owners' share in unconsolidated farming land. Owner $A$'s share in these rights did not amount to more than $5 \%$, so his own financial interest in hydro-power was in fact limited compared to the owners who opposed development.

On the other hand, the rights needed for the necessary physical constructions were predominantly held by owner $A$ alone, and $A$ maintained his position that the court should use compulsion to allow him to go on with his plans. The court agreed that hydro-power would be rational use of the waterfall, and they initially assessed the case against Section 2 e) regarding compulsory joint undertakings. A decision made on the basis of this provision would allow the court to give more concrete directives regarding how the hydro-power development should be carried out, but in the end the court held that this would place too much of a burden on the owners opposing hydro-power. Hence they chose to decide the case on the basis of Section 2 c), as in the other cases we have considered. By doing so they also restricted the scope of their decision to the establishment of an owners' association that would be responsible for renting out the rights. The court would not consider the question of deciding on a concrete scheme.

The model used for the owners' association was similar to the one the court adopted in \emph{Oma}. This included an adjustment of the rights in the owners' association reflecting the special importance of land needed for physical constructions. In total, these rights were estimated at a value corresponding to $6 \%$ of the shares in the association. Since these rights were all held by owner $A$ alone, his share in the association was doubled. In addition to this, owner $A$ purchased the shares from owner $B$, so that his total share ended up amounting to $22 \%$. Still, for the majority of stakeholders, membership in the association was imposed by the consolidation court against their will.

The wording of the statutes for the association apparently attempts to take into account that it would be run by a majority of unwilling shareholders. The wording used is different from that used in the other statutes, and it is stated in very clear terms that the association is going to rent out the rights in the waterfall such that hydro-power can be developed. In \emph{Oma} and \emph{Vika}, on the other hand, the statutes merely state that this is the \emph{purpose} of the association, leaving the shareholders with greater freedom to determine whether or not to go through with development.

More generally, it seems that in the case of \emph{Dj√∏nno} the court attempted to facilitate development not so much by trying to make the owners more positive towards development, but rather by giving the proponent more power, providing him with a starting point which would make it easier to later enforce concrete hydro-power plans.

In interviews, those who were compelled to take part in the association against their will expressed dissatisfaction and surprise at the result. Moreover, while the association had ostensibly tried to be loyal to the wording of the statutes, and had looked for partners who might be interested in developing hydro-power, there had been no willingness among the majority to engage actively with this work. No deals had been made, no separate development company had been set up, and the conflict among the owners was ongoing. As of 2011, owner $A$ was still pushing for development on terms that were unacceptable to the other owners. Hence while the case of \emph{Dj√∏nno} is an example that consolidation can be used even when it involves compulsion against the majority of owners, it also serves to illustrate that the chance of a successful outcome may then be more limited.

The question arises as to why this is so, and how such cases will be dealt with by courts in the future. According to owner $A$, the problem was that the directives of use were not specific enough and that they should not have been restricted to merely setting up an owners' association for renting out the rights. In this case, more was needed. The court should actively engage also with the question of how the development company should be organized, and at least give guidance as to \emph{who} should be set with the task of carrying it out. Among the majority owners, on the other hand, the feeling appears to have been that the development in question, which they would be required to partake in against their will, was more or less doomed to fail already from the start.

This reflects two interesting viewpoints regarding such cases. Indeed, it seems reasonable to assume that unless one is prepared to see an increase in the use of compulsion, compulsory cooperation will only work when at least a basic agreement that development should take place can be established among the majority of the involved owners.

\subsection{The case of \emph{Tokheim}}

This case was brought before the consolidation court in 2008, by the owners of \emph{Tokheimselva}.\footnote{Indre Hordaland jordskifterett, Case no 1230-2008-0020.} The five involved owners all agreed that development should take place, but they disagreed about how it should be done, and about the proportion of each owners' share in waterfall. Some owners argue that development should be organized by the owners themselves, but other owners thought it would be best to rent out the rights to an external developer. The case was further complicated by the fact that the waterfall in question was so big that it would be possible to develop hydro-power that would require transferral concession pursuant to the Industrial Concession Act 1917, a concession that can only be given when the purchaser is a company where the State controls at least $\frac{2}{3}$ of the shares. 

Like the precious cases we have considered the consolidation court eventually based its decision on Section 2 c) of the Land Consolidation Act 1979, setting up an owners' association such that each owner was allotted a share in accordance to the rights that the court found he had in the waterfall. Unlike the previous cases we have considered, there was no adjustment made for land that would be needed for physical constructions. However, the statutes state that owners will be entitled to a lump sum estimated on the basis of the damages and disadvantages that a concrete hydro-power project will bring. This also marks a departure from established practice in expropriation law, where it has been a long established principle that owners can be compensated on the basis of \emph{either} the value of their waterfalls \emph{or} the damages and disadvantages caused by the project, not both.\footnote{See for instance the case of \emph{Vikfalli}, Rt. 1971 p.1217.} 

In other respects, the statutes for the owners' association follow the same model adopted in the previously considered cases. They do not, however, resolve any of the controversial questions regarding how development should be carried out, and the question of the extent to which interested owners should be given the opportunity to develop the resource themselves. This was the issue that the main conflict in the case centered on, and the consolidation court explicitly decides not to implement any solutions in this regard. In particular, the statutes of the owners' association explicitly provides separate rules that cover both the case that a group of owners undertake development themselves, and the case that development is carried out by an external company. 

In interviews, the owners expressed that they were happy with how the case was dealt with by the court. Everyone appears to have been heard, and the owners' association was set up in consultation with the parties. However, the main issues were still unresolved as of 2011, and this was felt by the owners as a major shortcoming of the outcome of consolidation. Some of the owners expressed criticism against the court for not engaging more actively with what appeared to be the most pressing issues.

The case of \emph{Tokheim} serves to illustrate that established practices of consolidation, while being well received and understood by local owners, face some new challenges in relation to hydro-power, challenges that consolidation courts might be reluctant to take on. It seems that the court in \emph{Tokheim} felt that they were not in a position to assess the question of what kind of development would be best, and it also seems that they were wary of expressing any opinion about the legal status of a project led by local owners, in relation to concession law. They did not, in particular, form an opinion about whether it would be possible for local owners to carry out their own large scale development, in a waterfall that might otherwise be subject to the provisions set out in the Industrial Concession Act 1917.

It remains to be seen whether such an agnostic attitude can be maintained by the consolidation courts as local owners increasingly turn to them for help in resolving disputes regarding hydro-power. Moreover, it will be interesting to see how the new Land Consolidation Act 2013 will influence case law in this area. It seems that a case like \emph{Tokheim} could benefit from the court taking a broader view, possible even including public bodies as parties in the case, as will become possible when the new Act takes effect. In this way one could perhaps have hoped for a more conclusive outcome, a solution that gave sufficient consideration both to the public interest and the interests of local owners.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:6}
