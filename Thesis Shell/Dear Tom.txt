Dear Tom, 

I have finally managed to complete a draft for my PhD, which I enclose. I feel I need to do some more polishing and referencing before I submit, 
but I think the structure is there now and there is not too much work left before I can formally hand it in. I hope you agree, and I would 
be very happy to hear your comments. 

I am hoping to come to Durham in early March, so maybe if you are around then we could arrange for meeting in person? I will get in 
touch with Kellie when I now more exactly when I can make it over.

I regret that it has taken so long to reach this stage, but I was delayed further after Christmas, 
due to my obligations in the Netherlands and because I had to write an appeal for the Supreme Court in the case I mentioned last fall. 
We lost the case on a point of law, so we are hoping that the Supreme Court will find it interesting enough to hear it. 

I hope you are well and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,
Sjur
